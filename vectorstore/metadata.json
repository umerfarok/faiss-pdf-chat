The Code of Ethics has been created to support the members (students, teaching staff, \nemployees) of the Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences (hereinafter \nreferred to as the EUAS) in recognising, preventing and solving complicated situations. The \nCode of Ethics reflects the organisational cultur e and significant moral values of the EUAS.  \n2. As members of the EUAS, we are responsible for ensuring that our conduct is ethical. The \npurpose of the Code of Ethics is to support the promotion of ethical standards among the \nmembers of the EUAS and to strengt hen the common understanding of ethical conduct in \ncommunication with one another and with partners, owners and the society in general.  \n3. The ethical principles described in the Code of Ethics comply with the core values, mission \nand vision of the EUAS. The core values of the EUAS are:  \n\u2022 Responsibility and care \u2013 we take a responsible attitude towards work and studies and \nvalue the organisation and the development of its members. We notice and take into \nconsideration the needs, expectations, activities and achi evements of our colleagues, \nstudents, alumni and partners on a daily basis.  \n\u2022 Science -basis and entrepreneurship  \u2013 we create an environment for students that \nsupports entrepreneurialism and creativity and the acquisition of knowledge based on a \nscientific ap proach and applicability. In cooperation with members and external \nstakeholders, we initiate and effectively implement improvements and changes in the \norganisation and society.  \n\u2022 Innovation and openness  \u2013 we are open to new ideas and solutions and apply them  \neffectively. We establish and foster cooperative relationships with various partners at \nhome and abroad. We grant equal access to studies to all motivated and capable people \ninterested in them.  \n4. The success of the EUAS depends on trust among members and a good reputation. We value \nall of our members and support ethical conduct. We expect the members of the EUAS to \nconduct themselves according to our Code of Ethics and values. The members of the EUAS \nensure that the activities of the company comply with the laws and legislation that apply in \nthe places the company is represented.  \n5. A member of the EUAS reports any act or conduct that is reprehensible and in contravention \nof ethical principles in order to end the reprehensible act or conduct. A written report ca n be \nsubmitted to the ethics committee if no action is taken after attention is drawn to the \nreprehensible act or conduct and it is allowed to continue (see Annex 1. Work Procedure of \nthe Ethics Committee).  \n6. A reprehensible act or dishonourable conduct mean s ignoring generally acknowledged \nstandards of behaviour or internal guidelines or violating the law.  \n \nII RESPONSIBILITIES  \n7. The EUAS ensures that its members can view the Code of Ethics in the SIS, but each member \nis personally responsible for compliance with the Code of Ethics and the implementation of \nethical principles.  \nCode of Ethics of the EUAS  \n  3 \n   \nIII HEALTH AND SAFETY  \n8. The EUAS is a socially responsible company. Health and safety play an important role in joint \nactivities and these aspects must be considered in everything related  to students, employees, \nteaching staff and partners. A member of the EUAS behaves in a manner that does not \njeopardise their own health and safety and that of others.  \n9. The members of the EUAS create an environment where parties feel safe in order to draw t he \nattention of other members or their line manager to smaller or bigger problems.  \n \nIV BEHAVIOUR BASED ON OPENNESS AND MUTUAL RESPECT  \n10.

The EUAS fosters an environment that is favourable to learning and development. A lecturer \nis independent in teaching their subject according to the established curriculum, learning \noutcomes and ru les of organisation of studies.  \n27. The acquisition of higher education is a free decision and is the responsibility of the students. \nBeing a student or a lecturer calls for responsible and determined action in academic and \nscientific work and being strict wit h yourself. Academic activities are based on honesty, \nresponsibility, correctness, dignity, punctuality and accuracy.

The lect urer assesses the outcomes of the student's work objectively and without bias and \ndiscloses the results anonymously or in the manner agreed with the student. The lecturer as \na supervisor communicates with students cooperatively and benevolently, supports t he \nsupervised student and fosters their personal development.  \n30. The lecturer follows the principles and values of the Code of Conduct for Research Integrity \nand expects this of their colleagues and students as well, reports any breaches of academic \nethics an d asks colleagues for advice in the case of suspicions. Academic fraud in any form \nwhatsoever is impermissible and punishable according to the seriousness of the fault.  \n \nVIII.3 ESTONIAN CODE OF CONDUCT FOR RESEARCH INTEGRITY  \n31. The members of the EUAS proceed from the principles and values of the Estonian Code of \nConduct for Research Integrity  prepared by research institutions, the Estonian Academy of \nSciences and the Ministry of Education and Research and follows the principles and \nregulations of personal data protection.  \n32.

The \npersons involved are informed of the nature of the research (ob jective, methods, use of \nresults, data protection), and the positive impact and benefits of the research are shared with \nthem.  \n35. As a reviewer and an expert, the member of the EUAS guarantees that they perform their \nactivities to a high quality and in a time ly manner and that the research results are kept \nconfidential and behaves in an objective and unbiased manner. If necessary, e.g. upon the \nemergence of conflicts of interest, the researcher removes themselves from the position of \ndecision -maker, assessor, reviewer or expert.  \n36. In the case of the publication and implementation of the results of research, the member of \nthe EUAS considers the interests and rights of all researchers and partners who contributed \nto the research in issues concerning authorship, int ellectual property and recognition. As a \nresearcher, they disclose all of the conflicts of interest related to their research well in \nadvance and inform the magazine or publisher of any financial or other interests and personal \nrelationships that influence  the reliability of the research.  \n37.

If there is no consensus, the chair will call the ethics committee again in five \nworking days. If no consensus is  reached, the ethics committee will adopt a justified position on \nthe basis of a majority vote. If necessary, the ethics committee makes a proposal to the Rector \nregarding the action to be taken by the school within two days of the ethics committee making a \njustified decision.  \nUpon the proposal of the ethics committee, the Rector has the", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:17.914992"}, {"source": "Code of Ethics-2.pdf", "path": "database\\Code of Ethics-2.pdf", "chunk": 2, "page_content": " the ethics committee \nobtains written letters of explanation from the persons directly involved in the case, if possi ble \nand necessary, in order to obtain a thorough overview of the case and give the parties the \nopportunity to explain themselves.

Independent work is the independent acquisition of knowledge and skills necess ary for \nachieving learning outcomes according to tasks set by a lecturer or instructor.  \n34. A student shall participate in studies either with a full -time or part -time study load while \nstudying in a course system or according to an individual study plan.  \n35. A stu dent studying in a course system shall complete the courses in the order  and volume  \nspecified in the curriculum. The transfer of a student to the next year requires the completion of \nthe previous academic year\u2019s courses, meeting the respective requirements  and passing the \nrequisite exams.  \n36. It is possible to study full -time or part -time based on an individual stud y plan, including as an \nextramural learner.  \n37. When studying with an individual study plan, the student has the right to select modules and \ncomplete co urses in the order they choose while taking into account the requiremen ts laid \ndown in the curriculum.  \nThe students who have not completed the entire curriculum (except for the final thesis) by the \nend of the nominal period of studies must prepare  and submit an individual study plan in order \nto participate in studies.  \n38. The student shall  prepare and  submit an individual study plan through the EUAS study \ninformation system by the deadline specified in the academic calendar. The individual study \nplan shall be approved by an employee of the study department . \nPlanning studies  \n39. When planning studies, EUAS guarantees a student studying in the course system the chance to \ncomplete their studies by the time determined in the study agreement, while keeping in mind \nthe eq ual division of the study load.  \n40. The beginning and end of an academic year and the deadlines f or study activities shall be \ndetermined in the academic calendar.  The academic calendar shall be approved by the head of  \nAcademic Affairs.  \nRegulations on Organisation of Studies of EUAS  \n7 (15) \n \n 41. The division plan for the curriculum and study sessions form the basis for the creation of a \nlecture plan. The head of Academic Affairs shall confirm study sessions.  \n42. The lecture plan  for a semester  is made available to students on the EUAS home page  and in \nLMS at least one week  before the study semester  begins.  \n43. Unscheduled changes to the lecture plan shall be communicat ed through LMS and/or via e -mail \nto the student\u2019s EUAS e -mail address.  \nStudy load and study progress  \n44. Study load is measured in credits based on the volume of cours es completed in the curriculum.  \nStudents\u2019 study progress is checked twice per academic year.  \n45. With a full -time study load, the student shall complete cumulatively at least 75% of the \ncurriculum meant for completion by the end of every  academic year.  \n46. With a part -time study load, the student shall complete cumulatively 50 -75% of the curriculum \nmeant for completion by the end of every academic year.  \n47. An extramural learner  completes a study load that is less than part -time study load.  \n48. A full -time student can submit a request to be transferred to a part -time study load.  \n49. An extramural learner can apply for  matriculation into part -time studies if at least 50% of the \nrated volume of the curriculum has been completed or into full -time studies if at least 75% of \nthe rated volume of the curriculum has been completed.  \n50. Before the beginning of the academic year, a student in the course system (both full -time and \npart -time) shall be assigned a year (1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th) according to the volume o f courses \ncompleted previously.  \n51. Transfer to the next year is allowed for students who meet the following conditions:  \n51.1. full-time students ; \n51.2. part -time students who have completed the required volume  marked in the curriculum;  \n51.3. students who have fulfilled their financial obligations arising from the study agreement; \nand \n51.4. students who are not currently on academic leave.  \n52.

Assessment is carried out according to the directive \u2018Unified assessment system at the higher \neducation level, with conditions for awarding a diploma with honours ( cum laude )\u2019 of the \nMinister of Educ ation and Research.  \n60. Depending on the curriculum, assessment may b e course -based or module -based.  \n61. A course or module shall be considered to have been completed once a positive result is \nachieved when learning outcomes are assessed. The grades \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019, \u20183\u2019,  \u20184\u2019, \u20185\u2019 and \u2018pass\u2019 are \npositive results on the assessment scale, while \u20180\u2019 and \u2018fail\u2019 are negative results.  \n62.

A student who has been exmatriculated because of inability to pay the tuition fees can apply \nfor rematriculation after paying their tuition fees within one year for a reinstatement fee.  \nVII STUDENTS\u2019 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS  \nNotifications  \n125. The EUAS shall notify students about changes to the organisation of studies and directives  \nthat concern them throug h LMS . \n126. Information about organisational changes and other notifications shall be sent to the \nstudent\u2019s EUAS e -mail address. With this, EUAS shall consider the message to have been \nforwarded. A student may request that notifications be sent to  their personal e -mail address.  \nAdditional rights and obligations of student  \n127. A student has the right to:  \n127.1.  request proof confirming their student status;  \n127.2.  elect representatives and be elected to the EUAS student council;  \n127.3.  turn to employees involved in the organisation of studies, or lecturers, to receive \ninformation and advice in order to resolve problems related to studying at the EUAS;  \n127.4.  apply for a student loan and education allowance according to the rules set out by the \ngovernment of the Republic of Esto nia; and  \n127.5.  use the university\u2019s rooms according to the effective rules.  \n128. A student has the obligation to:  \nRegulations on Organisation of Studies of EUAS  \n14 (15) \n \n 128.1  follow the regulations on the organisation of studies, the study agreement and other \nobligations and take responsibility for any violations;  \n128.2  observe the deadlines set out in the academic calendar;  \n128.3  observe study discipline and the requirements of the curriculum and course \nprogrammes;  \n128.4  pay the tuition fee according to the study agreement between the student and the \nEUAS; and  \n128.5  take  care of the university\u2019s assets and show respect  for the university\u2019s property.  \nDisputing decisions regarding studies  \n129. If a student does not agree with a decision regarding a study result or the organisation of \nstudies, they have the right to first turn to  the decision -maker (lecturer or employee involved \nin the organisation of studies) to receive an exp lanation or reason for a grade.  \n130. The student has the right to submit a written appeal within seven working days of the \npublication of results or an organisat ional decision.  \n131. The head of  Academic Affairs may convene a three -member committee to review the appeal.  \nThe committee will process the complaint and will present the head of Academic Affairs with \na reasoned viewpoint with in seven working days.  \n132. The head of  Academic Affairs must make a decision regarding satisfying or rejecting the \nappeal within 10 working days of the date of the submission of the appeal.  The appeal \ncommittee does not change the grade of the appealed study result, but can make suggestions \non changing the grade.  \nVIII ASSESSMENT SYSTEM  \n133. The EUAS assessment system can be differentiated or undifferentiated.  \n134. In the case of differentiated assessment, students\u2019 level of achievement of learning outcomes \nis differentiated on the basis of the following scale:  \n134.1.  grade \u20185\u2019  or \u2018excellent\u2019  \u2013 Learning outcomes have been achieved at an o utstanding \nand particularly thorough level , which is characterised by free and creative use of \nknowledge and skills above the \u2018 good \u2019 level;  \n134.2.  grade \u20184\u2019  or \u2018very good \u2019 \u2013 Learning ou tcomes have been achieved at a very good level,  \nwhich is characterised by purposeful and creative use of knowledge and skills.  Non -\nsubstantial and non -fundamental mistakes may occur in respect of more specific and \ndetailed knowledge and skills;  \n134.3.  grade \u20183\u2019  or \u2018good\u2019  \u2013 Learning outcomes have been achieved at a good level, which is \ncharacterised by purposeful use of knowledge and skills. The student demonstrates \ninsecurity and inaccuracy in respect of more specific and detailed knowledge and skills.  \n134.4.  grade \u20182\u2019 or \u2018satisfactory\u2019 \u2013 Learning outcomes have been achieved at a satisfactory \nlevel, which is characterised by the use of knowledge and skills in typical situations, but \nthe student demonstrates deficiencies and insecurity in exceptional situations;  \n134.5.  grade \u20181\u2019  or \u2018poor\u2019  \u2013 The most important l earning outcomes have been achieved at \nthe minimum allowable level, which is characterised by limited use of knowledge and \nskills in typical situations. The student demonstrates significant deficienc ies and \ninsecurity in ex ceptional situations;  \n134.6.  grade \u20180\u2019 or \u2018fail\u2019  \u2013 The student\u2019s level of knowledge and skills is below the required \nminimum level.  \nRegulations on Organisation of Studies of EUAS  \n15 (15) \n \n 135.

Consequently, students of both the applied higher education and Master\u2019s \nprogrammes of the Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied S ciences are required \nto acquire the skills of wording, explaining and analysing speciality -specific problems in \nwriting.  \nThese guidelines set out the requirements for composing and formatting student papers in \nthe Estonian Entrepreneurship University of A pplied Sciences (from now on referred to as \nEUAS). These general requirements apply to all EUAS student papers, both those composed for educational purposes (essays, report papers, reports, projects, etc.) and final papers and \nMaster\u2019s theses required for graduating from different higher education programmes and \nlevels of training. The guidelines set out the main differences between the types of papers. \nAdditional requirements for special types of written papers (e.g. internship reports) are given \nin the co mposition instructions for the respective written paper and/or the study programme.  \nThe content and format of the guidelines were updated by a working group established at the \nEUAS Centre for Excellence in Learning and Teaching  in 2020, which consisted of  Piret \nEinpaul, Anneli Rumm, Tauno \u00d5unapuu, Aire Vaigu and Roosi Tilk. Later in year 2023, Anneli Rumm, Eneken Titov, Ly H\u00f5be, Marina J\u00e4rvis, Olga Uhabakin, Olga Ne\u017eerenko, \nInna \u0160vartsman, Meelis Zimmermann contributed to update guidelines. \n  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n6  \n  1. GENERAL  REQUIREMENTS FOR AND TYPES OF STUDENT PAPERS  \nStudents must write many independent written papers during their university studies by \napplying the knowledge acquired in the course thereof, thus demonstrating their knowledge \nof the subject and speciality as well as the skills of analysing and solving various problems \nin their field of study. Compiling independent written papers is, therefore, an essential part \nof acquiring higher education.  \nEducational assignments (essays, papers, reports, projects, etc.) above all facilitate the \ndevelopment of skills related to working with specialist literature and the systematic and \nanalytical treatment of speciali ty-specific problems.  \nResearch papers (final papers and Master\u2019s theses) must demonstrate the student\u2019s ability to \ncarry out independent research and present the results thereof duly. Research papers are submitted according to the deadlines set out in the  academic calendar.  \n1.1. Ethical and content requirements for student papers  \nThe generally applicable requirements for academic texts must be observed in all student \npapers composed in the course of studies:  \n\u2022 credibility and validity  \u2013 all arguments presented  in papers must be supported by \nsource references, verified facts or analysis results so that readers could reach the \nsame conclusions as to the author  \n\u2022 structure  \u2013 papers must follow the standard structure for academic texts (see \nChapters 1.2 and 3.1)  \n\u2022 correct language and style \u2013 all student papers must follow the linguistic and \nstylistic requirements established for academic texts (see Chapter 3.2)  \nStudent papers must be composed in accordance with the principles of academic ethics.  \nAdding due referenc es to the opinions, works , and data of other authors is mandatory. \nReferencing is an agreement valid in the academic world, which is used to acknowledge the \ncontributions of earlier authors, certify that the paper is based on reliable resources , and offer \nreaders the opportunity to find and use the sources referenced.  \nThe principles of research ethics apply to all stages of student research papers (planning, \nexecution, and presenting results). This includes ensuring voluntary participation in \nComposing and formatting student papers \n7\n research, inf ormed consent, prevention of damage, anonymity or confidentiality of research \nsubjects and data protection.  \nUsing large language model -based chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) or other tools based on artificial \nintelligence in education, the method of use of the tool must be clearly described (including \nthe prompt and the output obtained). The student must check and evaluate the output \nobtained to ensure its veracity. The output may be used only to a justified extent, referencing \nquoting (see Chapter 4.1). The use of tools must be referenced within the text (e.g., I used \nChatGPT to generate ideas (OpenAI, personal communication, 15.08.2023) or created an \nillustration with Midjourney (Midjourney, personal communication, 10.08.2023) and \npresent the input -outputs of the  conversation in the appendix of my work (questions -\nanswers).   \nAs authors, students are solely responsible for ensuring that the paper submitted meets \nethical and copyright, confidentiality and data protection requirements. \n1.2. Educational papers \nEducational papers do not include conducting research and are composed to acquire \nknowledge and skills in finding specialist literature, collecting, classifying, comparing and \nanalysing specialist views and drawing conclusions.  \nA term paper/report is a scientific summary of a specific problem or topic, which is above \nall composed on the basis of written sources about the subject addressed. Writing a report improves students\u2019 ability to use specialist literature and highlight the most important and \nrelevant views presented therein. A report is not simply a collection of paragraphs copied \nfrom original texts, but a structured and coherent text addressing the topic, where the sources \nused must be correctly referred to. Reports have the following structure: introduction, body, \nconclusion and list of references. The topic, requirements for the literature used and the \nvolume of the report are determined by the lecturer of the subject.  \nA summary report  describes a specific problem related to the subject or compares the views \nof different authors on", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:24.788365"}, {"source": "EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "path": "database\\EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "chunk": 1, "page_content": "2.

The topic, requirements for the literature used and the \nvolume of the report are determined by the lecturer of the subject.  \nA summary report  describes a specific problem related to the subject or compares the views \nof different authors on a subject, whereas the author\u2019s own opinion is not presented. A \nsummary report does not require students to highlight innovative positions on the basis of \nmaterials read, but they still need to draw conclusions. It is important to c onvey the contents \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n8  \n  of source materials adequately and differentiate clearly between one\u2019s views and the text \nsummarised.  \nA research/analysis report  includes students\u2019 reasoned opinions and assessments on the \nviews presented or the problem addressed in the  literature, but the main emphasis is still on \nreporting the views of other authors. Writing a research report requires students to \nunderstand and adequately convey the contents of sources summarised; students need to be \nable to analyze  different texts, fi nd views that connect or divide different sources , and report \nthem systematically.  \nAn essay  is a short , argumentative , often critical reasoning on a topic, problem or \nphenomenon. Even though essays express and present the author\u2019s personal opinions or views, it is important to address the problem in a logical, argumentative and clearly defined \nmanner. An essay generally begins with a (preferably original) claim, which is followed by \nthe author supporting it with suitable arguments, bringing out both pros a nd cons , or finding \nsolutions to the question posed. Writing an essay requires students to understand the topic addressed, including different viewpoints and the ability to analyse and assess them; it is \nalso important for students to have their own opinion or a personal view with regard to the \nquestion at hand and to be able to present it in a reasoned and logical manner. An essay \nusually consists of three basic parts: an introduction, in which the problem or the main idea \nis worded; a body, in which the t opic is discussed by presenting arguments for and against \nit; and a conclusion, which provides a summary of the main idea and the arguments that support it.  \nCompared to reports, essays are valued for their freer, personal and creative use of language \nthat is based on a good academic style and the opportunity to express personal opinions on \nand attitudes towards the topic addressed. However, essays are more demanding than reports \nwhen it comes to their contents, style and presentation of ideas, as they require students to \nuse a style characteristic to essays and express themselves in an idiosyncratic way.  \nA portfolio is a set of materials reflecting a student\u2019s personal development, which is used \nto organise studies and as an assessment method. A portfolio consists of work done during \nstudies and other collected and composed materials that allow students to highlight, analyse \nand reflect on their studies, development and skills and experiences acquired. A portfolio \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n9  \n  must include both self -analysis and evidenc e materials and have a logical and systematic \nstructure.  \nAn internship report  is an analytic summary of internship, which provides an overview of \nthe tasks performed, knowledge acquired, self -development and the compliance of the \ninternship completed with  the objective. An internship report contains opinions and \nproposals to improve the respective field of activity in the internship institution and the \nintern\u2019s assessment of their development and the experience acquired during the internship. \nThe specific content requirements of the reports submitted for internships set out in the \nEUAS curricula and the principles of their composition are established in the respective \ninternship guidelines. The requirements set out by these guidelines must be followed when \npreparing an internship report.  \nA subject paper  is an analytical paper written independently on a subject related to a \nspeciality, which draws on evidence -based sources. Writing a subject paper helps students \nacquire the skills of finding specialist liter ature in Estonian and foreign languages, working \nwith specialist materials and presenting meaningful comparisons and assessments of \ntheoretical treatments and empirical studies by different authors and composing and \nformatting a paper based on the conventi ons of academic writing and the structural principles \nof academic texts. Subject papers are written under group guidance. The schedule, topics \nand requirements for the source materials of subject papers are determined in supervising \nseminars. Specific requ irements are described in the subject paper guidelines.  \n1.3. Research papers: final papers and Master\u2019s theses  \nIn research papers, students must pose a research problem, choose a methodology suitable \nfor fulfilling their objective, work through reliable and r elevant materials on the topic and \nrefer to them correctly in their paper. Results of research papers must be presented \nanalytically with the student\u2019s own contribution. Correct formatting of the paper is also \nimportant. The process of composing research papers is described in detail in Chapter 2 of \nthese guidelines.  \nIn the final paper , students must prove their ability to use the competencies  acquired by \nconducting empirical or theoretical research , creating a practical solution,  and presenting \ntheir specialist knowledge rationally and efficiently . The thesis should also display the skills \nComposing and formatting student papers \n10\n of identifying and analysing problems and drawing conclusions on the basis thereof, using \nspecialist experience, literature, research methods and development tools and presenting the \nresults in a clear, correct and reasoned manner. Final papers are written under the guidance \nof a supervisor. The optimal length of a final paper is 30 pages (the main part of the work).  \nA Master\u2019s thesis  allows students to research a topical problem in their field in depth, \nanalyse collected information critically, explain their views and provide a meaningful and \ncomprehensive interpretation of research results. A Master\u2019s thesis can also be a practical \nstudy, in which the author\u2019s objective  is to find solutions and applications for important \nproblems in their subject field. Master\u2019s theses are written under the guidance of a supervisor and their optimal length is 40-60 pages  (the main part of the work).  \nThe volume of the main part of the work does not include the title page, summary, table of \nc\nontents, list of used literature, and appendices. The text of the paper must be presented \nsuccinctly, and exceeding the volume is allowed only in justified cases. The principles of \nassessing and defending final papers and Master\u2019s theses are set out in the EUAS Procedure \nfor Conducting Preliminary Debates and Defences of Student Research Papers.    \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n11  \n  2. COMPOSING A RESEARCH PAPER  \nThis chapter focuses mainly on the principles of composing final papers and M aster\u2019s theses, \nfrom now on jointly referred to as research papers .  \nWhen writing a research paper, it is important to choose a relevant and original topic, work \nwith relevant specialist literature, determine and define the research problem, pose research \ntasks  or questions , and/or hypothesis , choose suitable research methodology, collect and \nprocess data and analyse and present the results.  \n2.1. Choosing a topic  \nChoosing a topic is an important part of writing a research paper, and it depends on several \naspects. Firstly, it is important to choose a topic that is relevant and original in the field of \nstudy or important to the organisation studied . It is also important to ensure that \nconducting research on the topic chosen is feasible. Here, you need to consider  time, \navailability of suitable supervisors, your abilities and experiences and the existence and \navailability of specialist literature in the respective field. Even though the supervisor can also \nsuggest the topic, the student who conducts the research must be sufficiently interested in \nthe subject to work on it throughout the research period. The topic must be defined as specifically and precisely as possible and well -coordinated with the supervisor in terms of \ntype, length and the available source of mat erials of the research.   \n2.2. Composing a topic project  \nIn the initial stage, a topic project is prepared for final papers and Master\u2019s theses, which \ngives a brief (2 -3 pages) overview of the activities of the planned research and the method \nand schedule for c arrying them out. Compiling a topic project allows students to think \nthrough the topic and its treatment and prepare a research plan. The project provides a \nsystematic overview of the chosen field of research, the author\u2019s objective and the methods \nfor ach ieving the objectives. A topic project describing the purpose, contents and research \nmethod of the paper being written is an agreement between the student, the institution of \nhigher education and the supervisor \u2013 an approved topic project provides the student and \ntheir supervisor the certainty that writing a paper on the chosen topic and using the chosen method is permitted. If the topic, objective and approach described in the topic project \n", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:24.788365"}, {"source": "EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "path": "database\\EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "chunk": 2, "page_content": " source of mat erials of the research.   \n2.2. Composing a topic project  \nIn the initial stage, a topic project is prepared for final papers and Master\u2019s theses, which \ngives a brief (2 -3 pages) overview of the activities of the planned research and the method \nand schedule for c arrying them out. Compiling a topic project allows students to think \nthrough the topic and its treatment and prepare a research plan.

A topic project describing the purpose, contents and research \nmethod of the paper being written is an agreement between the student, the institution of \nhigher education and the supervisor \u2013 an approved topic project provides the student and \ntheir supervisor the certainty that writing a paper on the chosen topic and using the chosen method is permitted. If the topic, objective and approach described in the topic project \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n12  \n  change significantly in the course of writing the paper, the stude nt must submit a new topic \nproject.  \nThe structure of a topic project is as follows:  \n\u2022 The title of a research paper is formed on the basis of the topic of the planned paper \nand the type of research. The title must correspond to the objective and convey the  \ncontents of the paper as precisely and specifically as possible. The title is a phrase \nthat contains the basic terms of the research and the name of the organisation studied, \nwhere necessary . See Chapter 3.4.  \n\u2022 Research problem and objective \u2013 this subtopic  provides an overview of the topic \nchosen, its importance and background (e.g. why and to whom it is important to address this topic; how the topic has been addressed before; what remains unknown and what is going to be determined or developed in the given paper ; explains basic \nconcept ). This is followed by wording the objective that the paper aims to achieve  \n(for example, create a prototype of a 3D game, find out customer satisfaction with \nthe company's services) . Based on the contents of the research, eit her research \nquestions , tasks  or questions with hypotheses are worded; practical  research, i.e. \napplied research (practical solution), introduces the process of finding the solution \nand theoretical research explains the new contribution of the planned rese arch to the \ntreatment of the topic.  \n\u2022 The schedule  presents the main stages of research with their planned time. This part \nsets forth the intended times for the following activities: collecting and analysing \nliterature; the specification of the research sch edule; data collection, processing and \ninterpretation or planning activities required for creating a practical solution, the \nimplementation thereof and assessment of results; and writing of the paper.  \n\u2022 Research type \u2013 here it is specified whether the research is theoretical, empirical or practical and what is prepared as a result thereof, where possible (e.g. proposals made \non the basis of empirical research results to the management board for the \nimprovement or facilitation of something or a system or programme developed as a \npractical solution). The types of and differences between research types are described \nin subchapter 2.7 of the guidelines.  \n\u2022 Research methodology \u2013 this part of the topic project explains the activities \nnecessary for achieving the obje ctives and methods for collecting and analysing data \nas precisely as possible. The data collection methods (e.g. survey, interview, focus \ngroup interview, observation and document analysis) and measurement tools (e.g. information on the questionnaire used or the principles of preparing or customising \na questionnaire) are defined upon planning empirical research; planned activities and \nmethods used are presented in the case of a practical solution. The sizes of the \npopulation and the sample and the sample formation method (if a part of the \npopulation is studied) are presented depending on the methodology. If all members of the population are included in data collection (e.g. all employees of company X), \nit must be noted that the research is a population study . Information on the research \nprocedure is also presented \u2013 e.g. when, where and how the research is conducted, \nwhether it uses paper forms or a web survey, whether and how the anonymity of \nparticipants is ensured.  \n\u2022 The list of references  presents all sour ces used for preparing the topic project and \nany known sources that the author is planning on using in the research \u2013 this allows \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n13  \n  the reviewer of the topic project to assess the relevance and reliability of the sources. \nThis is a preliminary list and work with literature continues during the research.  \nIn addition to the above, the topic project must include the details of the author and the name \nof the supervisor at the beginning and the creation date of the topic project at the end. One \npossible example o f a topic project is given in Appendix 1 to the guidelines. \n2.3. Work with literature  \nIn order to address the topic comprehensively and in a research -based manner, the author \nhas to provide as extensive an overview of the topic\u2019s theoretical background and ear lier \nstudies as possible. You can start searching for information from the newest handbooks and \narticles. Earlier undergraduate theses defended on a similar topic can also serve as primary \ninformation sources. The lists of references of sources found can a lso give an additional \noverview of authors who have addressed the specific topic. Next, you need to define keywords that describe the research topic and can be used to perform more thorough searches \nof sources in library catalogues and international databa ses.  \nPreliminary exploration of literature allows students to define their research topic, obtain a \ngeneral overview of the subject field and the related terminology and helps to select a \nresearch method . According to  Hart (2018, 14) , primary analysis of sources helps:  \n\u2022 identify the relationship between theory and practice  \n\u2022 determine the context of the topic or research problem  \n\u2022 understand the nature of the research object  \n\u2022 find out what research methods, techniques, and analyses are used in research on the \nchosen topic.  \nAn initial list of sources used is also included in the topic project. Literature is read and \nanalysed more thoroughly when writing the theoretical part of the research, which is why \nthe list of references for a completed paper is different and  features considerable additions \ncompared with the topic project.  \nAs a result of the analysis of theoretical sources, the student gets an overview of the scientific \ndiscussion, the main research problems and questions of the chosen topic, an understanding  \nof how knowledge is structured and presented in research, what the primary sources of the \nterms and definitions used, and knowledge of fundamental theories, concepts, and ideas, and \nthe stages of development of the chosen topic (Hart, 2018, 27). \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n14  \n  Sources m ust be selected and interpreted critically. In research papers, reliable materials \ncompiled by acknowledged authors in the respective field should be preferred. Additionally, \nit is important to proceed from the most up -to-date sources possible when creatin g your \ntheoretical base. Textbooks, handbooks and popular science resources are not used as \nprimary sources. When using online resources, it is important to assess the truthfulness, \nsufficiency, reliability and relevance of materials presented and determine who created them, \nwhen and for what purpose. Scientific sources can be located via full -text databases (e.g. \nScience Direct and Ebsco) and other search environments (e.g. Google Scholar).  \nA final paper must be based on at least 20 and a Master\u2019s  thesis on at least 30 sources. To  \nprovide a scientific and up-to-date overview, the research must include foreign  language \nmaterials, which is why at least 1/3 of the sources used must be in a foreign language.  \n2.4. Reasoning the relevance of the top ic \nAssessment of the relevance and practical importance of one's work characterizes the \nstudent's academic maturity and professional competence. Both at the beginning of the \ntheme project and the introduction of the thesis and master's thesis, the relevanc e of the \nchosen topic must be justified from theoretical and practical perspectives. Critical analysis of sources, contemporary examples, and discussion in scholarly sources provide input for \nthe theoretical perspective. In the case of a practical perspect ive, the input is solution \nperspectives, an opinion based on one's knowledge and experience, and a specific company problem (e.g., statistics, internal company sources). \n2.5. Research problem and objective and research questions, tasks or hypotheses  \nA research  problem is an unsolved question or a theoretical contradiction that is based on \npractice, which does not have a clear solution or an answer and therefore requires more thorough research. When wording a research problem, you need to explain why it  is \nimpor tant to conduct this research. For instance, you can proceed from facts in order to \nexplain that the specific problem has not yet been sufficiently addressed in previous \nscientific studies or why the question or problem to be solved is important to the org anisation \nstudied. A specific research problem helps the author in later work, for instance, choosing a \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n15  \n  suitable research method. The description of the research problem is usually the main part \nof the introduction of final papers or Master\u2019s theses.  \nOnce the research problem is described, it is used to set the objective of the research.

The description of the research problem is usually the main part \nof the introduction of final papers or Master\u2019s theses.  \nOnce the research problem is described, it is used to set the objective of the research. The \nwording of the objective must correspond to the topic and title of the research paper, it must \nbe feasible in the context of the given research and result -oriented rat her than process -\noriented (cf. \u2018study\u2019 and \u2018determine\u2019).  \nDepending on the research strategy used, either research questions or research tasks  are \nworded or a hypothesis (hypotheses)  posed. Research questions  are questions that need to \nbe answered in order  to solve the research problem and achieve the objective, which give \nthe research a direction: what is studied and which questions should be answered at the end of the research.  \nResearch tasks  are activities required for achieving the established research  objective. \nResearch tasks allow both the author and the reader to monitor what has or has to be done in \norder to achieve the established objective (see Appendix 1).  \nResearch questions  are presented in the form of questions and must be answered in the \ncourse of the research. Research questions can supplement or replace research tasks.  \nA hypothesis  is a possible, scientifically substantiated answer to a research question \n(research questions) posed, which is based on facts, theory or earlier studies and pres ented \nas an argument. Hypotheses are only formulated if the research uses a quantitative approach, and it is explanatory or comparative research. Hypotheses are not set in the case of research \nwhere the author\u2019s objective is to describe or map something and, in such cases, research \nquestions or research tasks are established instead.  \n2.6. Research methods and research strategy  \nResearch can be conducted to describe, compare, explain, predict , or understand a \nphenomenon or an object. When choosing between differ ent strategies and methods, it is \nmost important to consider whether and how one method suits  a specific research problem.  \nA research method is a method of collecting data. There are empirical , i.e. experiential \nmethods (e.g. observations, interviews and surveys), and non -empirical methods, i.e. \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n16  \n  methods that are not based on immediate experiences (e.g. logical deduction and theoretical -\nabstract research based on reading).  \nA research strategy  is a collection of methodological solutions used in research, which are \nused to achieve the established objective. Referring to approaches used in research as either \nquantitative or qualitative is conditional (even though it is a long -standing tradition) because \na research paper may include elements of both , and, depending on the objective, combining \nthese methods may be justified.  \nQuantitative  methods are used to collect empirical data that are as objective as possible and \ncan be measured and processed quantitatively, i.e. numerically. To this end, standardized  \nquesti onnaires and systematic observation are used. Earlier theories and studies have an \nimportant role in quantitative research. Data are organized, and conclusions are drawn \ntherefrom with methods of statistical analysis using descriptive statistics, arithmetic means, \nassessment of statistical significance, correlations , and factor analysis.  \nQualitative methods are used to study an object or a phenomenon. Qualitative research does \nnot proceed from testing a theory or hypothesis but from highlighting new facts, identifying \npatterns, understanding meanings , and reflection. The research is descriptive, and data are \nobtained as words or images. Qualitative methods include interviews with open questions, \nparticipant observation, and discursive document and text anal ysis.  \n2.6.1. Research types  \nThere are three types of research: theoretical, empirical and practical. The terms \u201cpractical \nsolution\u201d or \u201capplied research\u201d are also used in relation to the latter. The differences are \ndescribed in detail below.  \nIn the case of the oretical research , the author aims to compare and critically analyse the \ndifferent problem treatments in the subject field and develop them further, highlighting the \ncontradictions between theories, earlier studies or theories  and the results of em pirical \nresearch papers. A theoretical research paper must make a new contribution to theory by analysing existing ideas and presenting new ones.  \nEmpirical research  addresses a phenomenon or a problem by finding answers to research \nquestions posed or test ing established hypotheses by collecting, interpreting and analysing \nComposing and formatting student papers \n17\n empirical data. The methods of collecting data required for research depend on the objective; \nfor instance, you can use surveys, interviews, observations and document analysis. Research \nresults are used to make proposals and offer possible solutions, and the opportunities to put \nthe results into practice are also analysed.  \nIn the case of practical research (a practical solution), the author aims to develop an original \nsolution that can be  practically used in an organization\u2019s work or everyday life. Examples of \npractical solutions include compiling study materials, developing and implementing  a \nsoftware solution or an information system, carrying out a business or a design project, service development and development , or improvement of a program  or a system used in a \nworking environment (e.g. induction programmes and remuneration systems). When improving the existing solution, it is necessary to study how it works, prepare a requirements \nanalysis, and select suitable technologies based on this. Presenting only the result, i.e. the \ndeveloped practical solution, is not sufficient in student papers. It is important to explain the \nprocess of reaching the solution, justify choices , and  analyse the underlying theoretical \nstarting points and best practices. The prepared solution must also be validated (such as \npotential users or developers). \nThe general structure of research papers is described in detail in subchapter 3.1 of these \nguidelines.  \n2.7. Population study or sample study \nThe volume of data required to make reasoned conclusions in a research paper depends \ndirectly on the objective and the research problem. A population  is a societal phenomenon \nor process or a number of objects, on the basis of which the author wants to draw reasoned \nconclusions as part of their research. There are two ways to study populations: firstly, you \ncan study all of its elements or a part of the population and use it to make conclusions about the whole population. If the population is relatively small (e.g. if you study the professional \nsatisfaction or engagement of employees of one company), it is reasonable to study all \nelements of the population, i.e. to perform a population study . If the population is big (e.g. \nyou want  to study the consumption decisions of the population of Estonia) and including all \nof its members is unthinkable, it is reasonable to study only a part of it. A part of the \npopulation selected for studying is called a sample . A sample must represent the p opulation \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n18  \n  in both volume and distribution: the sample size depends on the size of the population, and \nthe sample distribution must correspond to the population distribution (for example, by age \nor sex). You can use a sample calculator to determine the size of the sample.  \nThe principles of forming a representative sample depend on the research strategy used. \nWhen selecting a sample, it is important to consider the established objective, accessibility \nof the sample, the number of factors observed, the homoge neity of the population and the \nextent the sample corresponds to the population. In qualitative research, samples can be \ndeveloped until the materials are saturated, which means that the number of research \nparticipants is determined in the course of the re search and data are collected until repetition \nstarts to emerge and new topics, categories, explanations are no longer added, and thus the data collected can be used to make conclusions and generalisations.  \n2.8. Data collection, processing and analysis  \nThe selection of data collection methods depends on the established research objective and \nthe research strategy (see subchapter 2.6). Datasets  are processed so that the data collected \ncan be analysed . Data analysis and making conclusions is the most important r esearch stage  \n\u2013 this fulfils  the research objective.  \nQuantitative methods utilise statistical data processing and analyse statistically significant \nindicators depending on the purpose of the research (the most important trends are compared, grouped, and highlighted).  \nThe stages of data collection, processing and analysis in a qualitative study are not as clearly \ndistinguished as in the case of a quantitative study. Data are analysed with the help of \ninterview transcribing, identification of units of meaning, creation of a category system , and \nanalysis, for example.  \nThe mixed methods approach combines qualitative and quantitative methods from data \ncollection to data interpretation (Jason & Glenwick, 2016, 9). \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n19  \n  2.9.

Different interpretations, the reliability and validity of research results \nand the general importance and meaning of the research should also be discussed.

FORMATTING OF STUDENT PAPERS  \nThe rules that apply to the formatting of academic texts apply to all student papers. \nAdditional formatting requirements given in these guidelines are presented in coloured \nboxes.  \n3.1. Structure  \nAcademic texts adhere to the following basic structure: an introduction, a body and a \nconclusion.  \nLonger educational papers (e.g. reports) f eature:  \n\u2022 an introductory part \u2013 a title page, a table of contents and explanations of \nabbreviations where necessary;  \n\u2022 a body (the content of the research paper) \u2013 an introduction, theoretical starting \npoints, an introduction of earlier studies, a summary a nd a list of references; and \u2022  \nappendices (where needed) and the paper is divided into titled chapters and \nsubchapters.  \nThe structure of student research papers, i.e. final papers and Master\u2019s theses is as follows  \n(for more read page 53):  \n\u2022 a title page  \n\u2022 an author`s declaration \n\u2022 a resume (in Estonian and English)  \n\u2022 a table of contents  \n\u2022 abbreviations, terminology and lists of tables and figures where necessary  \n\u2022 an introduction  \n\u2022 the body of the paper (2 -3 chapters which present the theoretical background and \nearlier studies, research methodology, results and conclusions, a discussion and \nproposals)  \n\u2022 a summary  \n\u2022 sources used  \n\u2022 appendices (where needed)  \nThe title page is the first page of the paper, which presents formal and substantive \ninformation on the paper (se e Appendix 2). The most important part of the title page is the \ntitle, which must clearly present the contents of the paper. The title page elements, except \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n21  \n  the title, must be in Times New Roman  12 p or Calibri 11 p. The title of the page is presented \nin either Times New Roman  14 p or Calibri 13 p, centred, in bold capital letters .  \nThe title page includes  (see an example p 52) :  \n1) the name of the institution of higher education (centred, in capitals) and the name of \nthe curriculum (in the middle in small letters, except the first letter, e.g. \u2018Business \nAdministration\u2019)  and below it the name of the specialty (e.g., \u2018Marketing specialty\u2019) ;  \n2) the author\u2019s first and last name (above the title, centred, in small letters, except the \nfirst letters);  \n3) the title of the  paper (centred, in bold capital letters);  \n4) the type of paper (below the title, centred, in small letters, except the first letter, e.g.  \n\u2018Report\u2019, \u2018Written project\u2019, \u2018Essay\u2019, \u2018Internship report\u2019, \u2018Subject report\u2019, \u2018Final \npaper\u2019, \u2018Master\u2019s thesis\u2019);  \n5) super visor information on the right side of the page: first and last name, academic \ndegree (abbreviated); if the paper has several supervisors, their details are written \nbelow the details of the first supervisor; if the supervisor does not work in the \ninstitution of higher education, their workplace and position are also given in front \nof their name;  \n6) the city where the study centre is located  and the creation year of the paper (at the \nbottom of the page, centred). For example: Tallinn 2023 \nThe author's declarat ion is a mandatory part of the bachelor`s  and master's thesis, which \nis submitted after the title page and consists of the following text: \nI confirm that I have prepared the work independently and that it has yet to be previously \nsubmitted for defence by someone else. All other author's work, thoughts, points of view and \nsources of information are properly cited.  \nAuthor: [First and surname]  \n[DD.MM.YYYY]  \nA resume is the part of final papers and Master\u2019s theses that gives the reader a brief and \nconcise (1000 -1800 characters) overview of the contents of the research paper: the research \nproblem, the objective, a description of the methodology, the most important results and \nconclusions or an introduction of the solution developed. A good resume is brief, precise  \nand understandable as a separate text. A resume is composed in at least two languages: the \nstudy language and in a foreign language. Resumes written in foreign languages are \npresented after the resume written in the study language: a resume in English is added to a \nresume in Estonian (if the study language is Estonian); a resume in Estonian is added to a \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n22  \n  resume in English (if the study language is English); resumes in Estonian and English are \nadded to a resume in Russian. The exact title translation must b e given in all resumes written \nin foreign languages (respectively in English and/or Estonian). At the end of the resume, \nthere must be a text:  The thesis is in [language] and contains [pages] pages of text, \n[chapters] chapters, [figures] figures, [tables] tables.  \nThe table of contents presents a list of individual parts of the research with titles and starting \npage numbers. The table of contents gives the reader an overview of the structure of the paper and the relationships between the questions addressed therein. The titles in the table \nof contents must correspond to the titles in the text and follow the same style and format. All \nappendices' titles and  starting page numbers are given at the end of the table of contents.  \nLists of abbreviations, terminology, tables , and figures  \u2013 the list of relevant abbreviations \nand/or terminology (if these have been used frequently) used in the paper are given alphabetically  with explanations to ensure that the paper's contents  are understandable and \neasily followed. If there are few abbreviations and terms in the paper, these are explained in \nthe text upon the first instance of use.  \nIn the introduction, the author must provide the reasons for topic selection and support them \nwith arguments, describe and analyse the rese arch problem, establish and define their \nobjectives (what is addressed in the paper and how, what question is being answered and the relevance of the posed problem), formulate the research tasks, research questions or \nhypotheses required to achieve the obj ective and provide a brief introduction of the \ntheoretical background and an overview of the structure of the paper. The introduction is \nusually around 2- 4 pages.  \nIn the body of the paper , the author performs the research tasks required to achieve the \nestablished objective or tests their hypotheses. Problems are addressed by moving from \ngeneral parts, such as theoretical background and research methods, towards more specific \nempirical analysis or a practical solution.  \nThe theoretical part  is inarguably an  essential part of all types of research, including \npractical research, i.e. applied research papers. In this part, the author provides an overview \nof earlier treatments of the research problem established in the introduction and studies made \nand analyses the views of different authors by highlighting the pros and cons of different \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n23  \n  treatments and supporting them with arguments. In the case of practical research , this part \nis also used to explain the choice of a theory suitable for the planned solution and highlight \nthe benefits of the chosen method compared with other options. The central terms used are \nalso explained in this part of the paper.  \nResearch methodology  \u2013 in empirical research, the author presents data collection methods, \na list of used measurem ent tools (questionnaires, etc.) with a brief description and the \nprinciples of selecting or compiling them, the principles of sampling, the procedure for \ncarrying out the research and data analysis methods; in practical research, the author \ndescribes the process of creating (or improving) a solution, e.g. solution planning, mapping \nof the situation,", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:24.788365"}, {"source": "EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "path": "database\\EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "chunk": 5, "page_content": "of earlier treatments of the research problem established in the introduction and studies made \nand analyses the views of different authors by highlighting the pros and cons of different \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n23  \n  treatments and supporting them with arguments.

In addition to text, the results can be presented  with tables and figures. In the case of \na practical solution, this part describes  sketches of the application, intermedia ry versions , \nand the final version of the practical solution or application developed. The completed solution or application should also be tested and assessed, where possible (e.g. based on  \nsome standards or user feedback). The developed application is pr esented as an appendix to \nthe paper.  \nIn the discussion , the author links research results to those of earlier studies and theoretical \ntreatment, points out the differences and similarities and provides an assessment on the \nreliability, meaning and applica bility of their study. In the case of practical research, the \ndiscussion part is used to make proposals to assess the presented solution and show why the \nsolution offered is original or more efficient than current solutions and, where possible \n(depending on the contents and the possibility to assess the practical solution), gives  a more \nspecific assessment on the applicability of the research based on the results of the tests \nconducted.  \nIn the conclusion , the author provides a retrospective overview of the  most important parts \nof the text, presents the results obtained, and makes proposals for further research. The \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n24  \n  summary is not used to pose new problems or present views or conclusions about questions  \nnot addressed in the previous parts of the paper. It is  important to remember that the summary \nis not a mechanical combining of paragraphs from previous parts of the text, and the most \nimportant opinions from the earlier text must be presented in a new, conclusive , and clearly \ndefined way. The optimal length of a summary is 1 -2 pages.  \nReferences  \u2013 a duly formatted , unnumbered list of all materials referred to in the paper is \npresented alphabetically  at the end of the paper (after the conclusion).  \nAppendices  \u2013 data and materials that confirm and illustrate the  views addressed in the paper \nbut the presentation of which would interfere with the paper\u2019s readability (e.g. large tables \nand compiled questionnaires) are presented as appendices. Appendices are not included in \nthe length of the paper.  \n3.2. Language and styl e  \nEUAS student papers are generally composed in the study language. There are exceptions \nwhere the paper can be written in another language, but this must be coordinated with the \nOffice of Academic Affairs beforehand.  \nThe language of student papers must be grammatically and orthographically correct and \ncorrespond to the characteristics of good academic language. The text must be concise, \nneutral , and impersonal. All claims and conclusions must be substantiated; the author must \nuse the same basic scientific  terminology and explain terms  before or upon first use. \nEmotional expressions, ambiguity, colloquial language and slang, verbiage, excessive \nforeign words , and colloquialisms must be avoided. When working with foreign language \ntexts, students should avoi d the excessive influence of the foreign language on, for instance, \nsentence structure. It is important to convey the meaning of the text instead of mechanically \ntranslating individual words.  \nThe text must have a logical structure and form a coherent whol e regarding  language, \ncontent, and structure. The thought process must be  consistent and paragraphs logically \nconnected, expressions  unambiguous, the use of terminology correct and precise , and the \nuse of punctuation, names, foreign words , and abbreviations correct.  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n25  \n  3.3. Page layout  \nAll written papers must be in A4 format (210 \u00d7 297 mm). The top, bottom , and right -hand \nmargins should be 2.5 cm and the left- hand margin 3 cm. Justified text alignment is used to \nformat the body of the paper. The font should be ei ther Times New Roman  (12 p) or Calibri \n(11 p) in regular type , and the whole text must be in one font (Table 1 ).

Headings and table of contents  \nAll independent main parts of the paper are given headings. Headings must be short but \nprecise and correspond to the contents of the paper. General headings that do not disclose \nthe contents of chapters or subchapters, as well as questions and exclamatory sentences,  and \nabbreviations must be avoided.  \nThe independent main parts of the paper (the table of contents, the introduction, each new \nchapter, the conclu sion, the list of references and the resume) begin on a new page. \nSubchapters begin on the current page, provided that there is room for the heading as well \nas the following text.  \nAll chapters, subchapters and subclauses are numbered hierarchically using Arabic numerals \n(1. Chapter , 1.1. S ubchapter , 1.1.1. C lause , etc.). The author`s declaration, resume, table \nof contents, introduction, conclusion and the list of sources used are not numbered. The headings of all chapters and independent parts of the paper are written in capital letters , while \nthe titles of subheadings and clauses are given in small lette rs (except the first letter) using \nTimes New Roman  12 p or Calibri  11 p.

The table of \ncontents is formatted using Times New Roman  12 p or Calibri  11 p, while the list of headings \nis formatted using 1.0 line spacing. Bold or italics are not used in the table of contents.  \nComposing and formatting student papers \n28  3.5.\n Abbreviations, numbers and formulae \nUsing as few and as common abbreviations (no., p, cf., etc.) as possible in written papers is \nrecommended . When using acronyms, the full spelled -out form must be written out upon \nfirst use , followed by the acronym in brackets, e.g. the National Institute for Health \nDevelopment (NIHD). Exceptions are common acronyms whose full form is rarely  used \n(e.g., USA, UN, etc.).  \nIf the paper includes repeated abbreviations or symbols that are less common, it is \nrecommended to compile a list of abbreviations and symbols with the respective \nexplanations as a separate section after the table of contents. All of the abbreviations used \nmust be adhered to throughout the paper. Abbreviations are not used in headings.  \nSingle-digit numbers (0- 9) are written in words, while larger numbers and fractions are \nwritten in numbers (e.g. eight business days; 120 companies; 2/3). Ordinal numbers are \nfollowed by a full stop in Estonian. If a single -digit number is followed by a unit o f \nmeasurement or a symbol, it is written in numbers. There is a space between all units of measurements and the number, with the exception of the percent sign. When presenting \npercentages, only one decimal place is used. Financial indicators are presented using two \ndecimal places.  \nFormulae are presented on a separate row, preferably using left alignment. Single symbols \nand simple mathematical expressions are presented in the text. Formulae and equations can \nbe written with the help of a text editor (e.g. in MS Word using \u2018Insert equation\u2019). Formulae \nand symbols used therein are written in 12 p. The symbols used in formulae are written \nbelow formulae, each on a separate row. The explanations of symbols begin with the word \n\u201cwhere\u201d (without a colon). In each new formula, only the symbols appearing for the first \ntime are explained.  \nThe arithmetic mean is calculated using the following formula: \n(3 ) \nwhere N \u2013 volume of population, x  i\u2013 element of population  \n\nComposing and formatting student papers \n29  I\nf a paper includes several formulae, they mus t be numbered either using general numeration \nor by chapters (e.g. formula 1.3 where one stands for the chapter and three for the number \nof the formula). The number of the formula in round brackets is presented on the same row \nright from the formula.  \n3.6. Lists \nItems on a list are marked with either Arabic numerals in brackets, small letters or bullets (if \nthe items on the list are a direct continuation of the previous text). Numbering should be used in lists if you need to emphasise the order of the items or if you wish to refer to a \nspecific part of the list in the text. Lists are formatted using 1.0 line spacing. Lists can be \ncreated in MS Word using \u2018Bullet\u2019 or \u2018Numbering library\u2019.  \nThe layout of and the use of punctuation in lists depends on the number of words in the items \nof the list.  \nIf a bulleted list consists of single words or short phrases, the items of the list are written \nafter one another and there is no need to use punctuation.  \nThe Nordic Questionnaire on Positive Organisational Psychology foc uses on six \ndimensions of organisational life (Christensen et al. , 2012, 14):  \n\u2022i ndividual resources\n\u2022j ob resources\n\u2022j ob demands\n\u2022w ork -related states and attitudes\n\u2022i ndividual wellbeing\n\u2022o rganisational performance\nI\nf a list consists of longer phrases or sentences that include a comma, the items of the list are \nwritten after one another on separate rows and separated with a semicolon.  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n30  \n  The stages of production cost analysis in the case of activity -based accounting are \n(Strandberg & Teder, 2008, 2- 4):  \n1) ascertaining of manufacturing costs;  \n2) describing the production process in order to simplify the reflection of all costs \nand determination of cost drivers; 3)  determination of cost-drivers.  \n \nIf part of the list contains two or more sentences, the bracket after the number of the item is \nreplaced with a full stop. Full stops are also added at the end of each item on the list.  \nRegardless of level, value systems contain a number of attributes, and we can assert that \nvalues systems are (Abreu & Camarinha- Matos , 2008, 1208):  \n1. Individual- based \u2013 the values in a value system depend on the person. Different \npeople can use different values in an identical situation and they may have \ndifferent values.  \n2. Individual or social \u2013 individual values can be applied only for one member, while \nsocial values can be applied to more than one member.  \nIf an item on the list includes a list, the items on the general list are marked with numbers \n(1, 2, etc.) and the sub- list items  with small letters followed by a bracket, a),  b), etc.  \nLists should be presented using the same method throughout the paper. All lists must be \nprovided with an explanation or an assessment in the text of the paper. According to best \npractice, chapters or other parts of the paper should not end with a list.  \n3.7. Tables  \nTables present numerical data and important parts of the text compactly . Tables are \nnumbered throughout the paper using Arabic numerals. The general title \u2018Table\u2019 is written above the table on the left -hand side in bold, regular letters using Times New Roman 12 p or \nCalibri 11 p (References > Insert caption in MS Word). The table number follows this and \nas brief and concise a table heading as possible (in bold, regular letters). The spacing between \nthe title of a table a nd the table and the notes presented below must be 6 p", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:24.788365"}, {"source": "EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "path": "database\\EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "chunk": 7, "page_content": ", etc.) and the sub- list items  with small letters followed by a bracket, a),  b), etc.  \nLists should be presented using the same method throughout the paper. All lists must be \nprovided with an explanation or an assessment in the text of the paper. According to best \npractice, chapters or other parts of the paper should not end with a list.  \n3.7. Tables  \nTables present numerical data and important parts of the text compactly . Tables are \nnumbered throughout the paper using Arabic numerals. The general title \u2018Table\u2019 is written above the table on the left -hand side in bold, regular letters using Times New Roman 12 p or \nCalibri 11 p (References > Insert caption in MS Word). The table number follows this and \nas brief and concise a table heading as possible (in bold, regular letters). The spacing between \nthe title of a table a nd the table and the notes presented below must be 6 p.  \nText and numbers are presented in tables using Times New Roman  12 p or Calibri  11 p and \n1.0 line spacing. Tables are placed in the middle of the page. All table columns, preferably \nComposing and formatting student papers \n31  a\nlso the first column, must -have titles. It is recommended to place a table on one page. If the \ntable continues on the second page, the column titles must be presented again or the columns \nnumbered. Large tables with unprocessed open data (e.g. balance sheets) are presented  as \nappendices.  \nIt is best practice to not begin or end chapters or other independent parts of a paper with a \ntable. Each table must be related to the text of the paper, which means that the table is referred to in the text before it is presented or after  a brief introduction of the data presented \nin the table. This can be done using either direct referencing (the data in the following table characterise...) or indirect referencing, in which case the number of the table is marked at the \nend of the sentence  in brackets (Table 3). The table must be presented after such a reference \nat the first opportunity, and a longer comment can be added after the table. If the author wishes to draw attention to the table later in the paper, they must use indirect referenci ng \nand add the page number where the table is located.  \nIf abbreviations are used in a table, the explanations are given below the table, using the \ngeneral term \u201cNotes\u201d. Explanations are presented using Times New Roman  11 p or Calibri  \n10 p and 1.0 line spa cing. The above requirements are presented in table 3 as an example.  \nTable 3.

Images   \nStudent papers utilise a range of illustrative materials, such as diagrams, graphs, figures, \ncharts, photos and drawings, in order to visualise the text.  \nImages are centred, and the text and nu mbers therein are presented in Times New Roman 12 \np or Calibri 11 p using 1.0 line spacing. Images should be designed so that the information \npresented therein is clear and easy to follow. When adding figures created in MS Excel, for \nexample, it must be en sured that the fonts and font sizes correspond to the guidelines of \nformatting student papers.  \nImages are marked with the general term \u2018Figure\u2019, followed by the number of the figure and \na brief description of the contents thereof (in bold, regular letters ) using Times New Roman  \n12 p or Calibri  11 p and 1.0 line spacing. Titles of figures (captions) are given below figures \nand aligned left, using 6 p spacing between the figure and the caption and 18 p spacing between the caption and the following text . The name of the scale must be displayed on the \nY and X axes, and the legend should preferably be placed on the right side of the chart. \n \nFigure 1.

When \nreferencing in the text, the type and number of the image are given in round brackets (e.g. \nFigure 1 or Photo 3). Longer explanations or comments can be added below figures. Larger \nillustrative materials (more than 0.5 pages) are presented as appendices.  \n3.9. Appendices \nData and materials that confirm and illustrate the views addressed in the paper, but the \npresentation of which would interfere with the paper\u2019s readability (e.g. large tables and compiled questionnaires), are presented as appendices. Appendices that have little \nconnection to the contents of the paper should be avoided.  \nAll appendices must be equipped with headings and numbered using Arabic numerals based \non the order in which they are referred to in the text. If only one appendix is added, it is not \nnumbered. Appendices and their headings are given in the table of contents.  \nThe word \u201cAppendix\u201d and the number and title of the appendix are written in the upper right \ncorner (e.g. Appendix 2.  Sample title page ).  \nIf appendices include tables or figures, these are presented as separate appendices, whereas \nthe respective table or figure are not given a separate heading or a subheading. If a table is presented on multiple pages, the titles of columns are given on each new page.  \nIf an appendix is a CD, a brochure or another data car rier that cannot be presented \nelectronically in the paper file, a printed version of the paper must also be submitted and the \nauthor\u2019s name, paper title and type and appendix title written on the data carrier. The data \ncarrier itself is presented with the printed paper in a pocket or envelope attached to the inner \nback cover of the paper. Appendices that are related to the paper, but not presented in the \nelectronic file, are listed on a separate page with the respective appendix numbers and \nheadings. The numbers and headings of all appendices are listed in the table of contents \nsimilarly to the appendices in the electronic file.  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n34  \n  4.  REFERENCING AND SOURCE MATERIALS  \nCorrect referencing is an essential part of academic literacy. Referencing is used to \nacknow ledge the authors of ideas and opinions used in the paper and allow the reader to \nreview the contents of original sources. Sources are textual, graphic and other materials that \nare composed by other authors or previously by the author, which are used for c ompiling the \nresearch. EUAS student papers must follow the referencing rules described in these \nguidelines, which are based on the referencing system published in October 2019 in the 7th \nedition of the publication manual of the American Psychological Assoc iation (APA).  \nA reference consists of two parts: an in -text reference and a more detailed source entry in \nthe list of references. In -text references are presented in the text in round brackets and \ngenerally consist of the author\u2019s last name, the publicati on year of the source and a page \nnumber(s).  \nIn the case of in -text referencing in EUAS student papers, the page number(s) must be added \nwhen citing materials by other authors, paraphrasing and summarising alike. Page numbers \nallow readers to locate the op inions of other authors in long or complicated texts more easily. \nIf the source used (e.g. some e- book) does not have page numbers, you can use the paragraph \nnumber or the name of the material\u2019s subdivision together with the paragraph number, e.g. \n\u2018Chamber in (2014, para. 1)\u2019.  \nThe first letter of the author\u2019s first name must only be specified in an in -text reference if the \npaper uses sources whose authors have the same last name. Sources used are presented in \nthe list in alphabetical order. A comprehensive table on referencing rules is presented in \nAppendix 4 of  the guidelines.  \nThe following general principles of referencing apply:  \n\u2022 The original source must be referred to each time the author summarises, paraphrases \nor cites the work of another author. The referencing requirement applies to both texts \nand graphic materials. The text of other authors used in the paper must be clearly \ndistinguishable from the author\u2019s own text.  \n\u2022 In-text references must correspond to the information presented in the list of \nreferences: each in -text reference must refer to an entry with more detailed \ninformation in the list of references, which is to include information only on those \nsources used in the paper and referred to in the text.  \nComposing and", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:24.788365"}, {"source": "EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "path": "database\\EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "chunk": 8, "page_content": "  \nThe first letter of the author\u2019s first name must only be specified in an in -text reference if the \npaper uses sources whose authors have the same last name.

Summarising, paraphrasing and citing  \nPositions of other authors and results of earlier studies can be presented in a paper either by \nsummarizing, paraphrasing or, in exceptional cases, citing.  \nSummarising  is making a faithful summary of the opinions and claims of one or several \nauthors in your own words. Good summarising requires the author to understand the contents \nof the materials read \u2013 the text must be reworded to reflect the original idea. Replacing \nindividual words in the original text is not summarising \u2013 in summarising, both the structure \nand vocabulary of sentences are changed. Summarising makes it possible to include opinions \nof other authors in your paper in terms of both style and vocabulary, which is why summaries \ncan be based on the work of several authors.  \nUpon summarising, a due  reference must be made to the source summarised. If the work of \nmultiple authors is summarised, all of the sources used must be referred to. Summaries must \nbe clearly distinguishable from the author\u2019s own text.  \nA paraphrase is a restatement of a shorter text part from the original source in the author\u2019s \nown words so that the result is different, but the meaning stays the same. Paraphrasing differs from summarising by its aims: the aim of paraphrasing is not to summarise something, but \nto explain the idea and views of the original source in your own words in the same length as \nor even longer than in the original text. Paraphrases are provided with a due reference to the \nauthor, the publication year and the page number, whereas quotation marks are not used.  \nWhen connecting a citation to a paraphrase, the part which is most difficult to explain using \nyour own words without distorting the meaning is presented as a citation (Ehala, 2000, \n152).  \nA citation  is a verbatim presentation of the original text in a pap er along with the wording, \northography, punctuation and distinctive textual elements (e.g. spacing). Citations are rarely \nused in research papers \u2013 they should only be used in those justified cases where the original \ntext is so irreplaceable and colourful that important meanings or the stylistic tone would be lost in paraphrasing. Citations should be as short as possible. Upon citing, the author must \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n36  \n  not add or leave out anything that would change the initial meaning nor should they combine \nparts of sentences from different places into one sentence.  \nCitations are given in quotation marks with a reference to the source and the page number.  \nThe introduction of the Estonian Lifelong Learning Strategy 2020 emphasises: \u201cWe are \nsuccessful only when we acknowledge the need to constantly learn and relearn and to be \nproactive and creative so t hat we can cope in today\u2019s rapidly changing world. Learning and \nthe knowledgeable application of skills must become an integral part of an active approach \ntowards life.\u201d (2014, 2)  \nIf only part of a citation is used, the parts of the sentences or words tha t are left out are \nreplaced with three dots between slashes.  \n\u201cIn addition to that, the writer must make sure that a citation would become a natural way \nof presenting information /.../\u201d (Hirsj\u00e4rvi et al. , 2007, 323).  \nIf the author only needs to cite certain words from the source, they may cite those words and \nparaphrase the rest of the text:  \nWhen combining a citation with a paraphrase, the part of the text \u201cthat is the hardest to \nparaphrase without distorting the meaning\u201d (Ehala, 2000, 152) is presented a s a citation.   \nCitations should be as short as possible. If a citation is longer than 40 words, it must be \ndistinguished from the rest of the text.  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n37  \n  Neuroscientist Jaan Aru (2017, 118 -119) explains the difficulties of using the brain in \ncontemporary worki ng environments as follows:  \nThe brain is a poor multitasker by nature. As a result, the brain unfortunately \nalways performs the tasks that require thinking linearly: every time you get \na professional phone call or need to answer a question submitted on social \nmedia, the brain must switch from one task to another. However, switching \nfrom one goal to another is based once again on the limited resources of the \nfrontal lobe. Thus the switching itself requires additional resources, extra \nenergy and depletes the reserves meant for thinking.  \nIn such a case, the citation is presented as an indented separate paragraph \u2013 space is left on \nboth the right and left side of the citation and quotation marks are not used.  \n4.2. In-text references  \nAll opinions, treatments, wr itings, citations, formulae, numerical data and images of other \nauthors must include references. The author\u2019s own earlier works must also be duly referred \nto.  \nIn the case of a citation, the reference to the source is given right after the quotation marks \nat the end of the citation, regardless of whether a whole sentence or part of a sentence is \ncited. In the case of a citation, it is also important to specify the page number of the source \nthe citation comes from.  \nEhala (2000) stresses that: \u201cAt the same t ime, summarising is the best method for forcing \nyourself to understand what is being read: summarising is impossible without understanding \nthe text\u201d (145).  \n\u201cAt the same time, summarising is the best method for forcing yourself to understand what \nis being read: summarising is impossible without understanding the text\u201d (Ehala, 2000, \n145).  \nIf a reference or a paraphrase consists of one sentence, the reference is given before the full \nstop (the full stop is placed after the reference). In the case of a reference that consists of \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n38  \n  several sentences, the reference is added after the full stop that ends the final sentence (the \nfull stop is before the reference).  \nUnderstanding the text is a prerequisite of summarising (Ehala, 2000, 145).  \nIdeas and opinions of oth er authors can be presented in papers as citations or paraphrases.  \nParaphrasing means conveying the thoughts of another author in your own words. (Ehala, \n2000, 151)  \nIf the name of the author referred to is already mentioned in the text, it is not repeated in the \nreference and only the publishing year and the page number of the source are given in \nbrackets after the author\u2019s name or the clause that contains it.  \nSociologist \u00dclo Vooglaid (2019, 89) stresses that lifelong learning is above all...  \nIf both th e author\u2019s name and the publication year of the source are included in the referenced \nor paraphrased sentence, there is no need to provide a separate reference in the brackets.  \nSociologist \u00dclo Vooglaid has included his treatment of man and the society in his 2019 \nbook Elanikust kodanikuks , focusing on...  \nIf the source referenced has two authors, the last names of both authors are given in the \nreference and separated with the \u2018&\u2019 symbol. The last names of authors are joined in the text using the conjunction \u2018and\u2019.  \n\u201cFinding a solution can be treated as a certain search process, where permanent memory \ndata and opportunities of creative fantasy give options in the human mind, finding the right \none of which is the decisive step\u201d (Bachmann & Maruste, 2003, 186).  \nBachmann and Maruste (2003) describe finding a solution as \u201ca certain search process, \nwhere permanent memory data and opportunities of creative fantasy give options in the \nhuman mind, finding the right one of which is the decisive step\u201d (186).  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n39  \n  If the s ource referenced has three or more authors, only the name of the author who is \nmentioned first is given in the text (also when referencing for the first time) with the \nabbreviation et al. (from the Latin et alia , meaning \u2018and others\u2019).  \nFrom the beginning of their studies, students of higher education institutions should use the \nnewest materials that originate from acknowledged research journals (Hirsj\u00e4rvi et al ., 2007, \n103).  \n", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:24.788365"}, {"source": "EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "path": "database\\EUAS research paper guidelines-3.pdf", "chunk": 9, "page_content": " options in the human mind, finding the right \none of which is the decisive step\u201d (Bachmann & Maruste, 2003, 186).  \nBachmann and Maruste (2003) describe finding a solution as \u201ca certain search process, \nwhere permanent memory data and opportunities of creative fantasy give options in the \nhuman mind, finding the right one of which is the decisive step\u201d (186).  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n39  \n  If the s ource referenced has three or more authors, only the name of the author who is \nmentioned first is given in the text (also when referencing for the first time) with the \nabbreviation et al.

(from the Latin ibidem , meaning \u2018in the same place\u2019) after the first \ncomplete reference and add the page number of the text referenced.  \nUnderstanding the text is a prerequisite of summarising (Ehala, 2000, 145). /.../ The ideas \nand opinions of other authors can be presented in papers as citations or paraphrases ( Ibid.,  \n151).  \nIf a reference is based on more than one source, all of the sources are mentioned in the \nreference. Sources by the same author are ordered on the basis of the  year of publication, for \nexample (Saal, 2008; Saal, 2011); works by the same author published on the same year are \ndistinguished by a small letter after the year, for example (Saal, 2008a; Saal, 2008b). Authors \nof different sources are presented in alphabetical order, and the last names of the authors are \nseparated with a semicolon.  \nA good introduction sparks the reader\u2019s interest to continue reading and provides basic \ninformation that is important for topic development (Ehala, 2000, 50; Hirsj\u00e4rvi  et al. , 2005, \n235).  \nWhen referencing views and ideas referred to by other authors in their writing and the student \ncannot access the original materials, they must be referred to via another source using indirect, i.e. secondary referencing. Indirect referencing is not good practice and should be \navoided by reading and referring to views that are important for the reliable treatment of the \ntopic yourself using the original source. When preparing an indirect reference, both the \noriginal source and the source that i s actually used are presented in the case of in -text \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n40  \n  references, using the phrase \u2018as cited in\u2019. Only the data of the source that the author used is \ngiven in the list of references.  \nIf the researcher focuses more on the research method rather than the phenomenon studied, \nthere is a great risk that the results obtained are meaningless or elementary because the \nresearcher\u2019s thinking may be thwarted as a result of such an approach (Loustarinen & \nV\u00e4liverronen, 1991, 147, as cited in Hirsj\u00e4rvi et al ., 2007, 65).  \nIf the author of the referenced source is an institution or an organisation, the name of the \ninstitution or the organisation must also be added to the reference as an author.  \nA code of ethics is a collection of written norms and values that help to solve problems of \nmorality and choose proper behaviours (University of Tartu Centre for Ethics, 2007, 22).   \nIf the referenced material is a source whose author is not specified (e.g. news stories and \nother texts), the title and the publication year of the so urce are given in the in -text reference. \nShort titles are written in full while only the first word of longer titles is given.  \nIn-text references to laws, court rulings and other legal documents must include the title of \nthe source, the publication year of the wording used and, where necessary, the specific \nsection or clause. Official abbreviations of laws (e.g. PDPA \u2013 Personal Data Protection Act) \ncan be used in in- text references.  \nEmployees have the right to study leave... (Adult Education Act, 2015, section 13).  \nIf a text includes a reference to an interview, a conversation or a correspondence that cannot \nbe reproduced and is inaccessible to the reader, the reference must contain the name of the author of the opinion, personal interaction, conversation or author\u2019s interview as a source \ntype and the date when the interaction took place, e.g. \u201cAccording to Mari Karm... (author\u2019s interview, 10 January 2020).\u201d In such a case, a source entry is not made in the list of \nreferences.  \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n41  \n  4.2.1. Referring to tables and figures  \nIf a paper includes a table with data or an illustration that comes from a source used, the \nreference to the source must be given below the table or the illustration in Times New Roman \n10 p or Calibri 9 p using 1.0 line spacing.  \n \nTable 4.

(2023). ChatGPT  \n(version 20 December). https://chat.openai.com/ . \n4.3. Source entries and list of references  \nThe list of references at the end of a student paper provides detailed information on the \nmaterials used in the paper. The list of references must only include materials that are previously referred to in the text. Depending on the source type, the source entry must \ninclude the names of the authors, the publication date (and the date of use, if necessary), the \ntitle, the publication house, the page numbers of articles used, the year of issue and website \naddresses.  \nSources are given in  the list in alphabetical order with each entry on a separate row. Sources \nwhose author is an institution or an organisation are added to the alphabetically ordered list \nin accordance with their names. Sources that do not have authors are added to the \nalphabetically ordered list on the basis of their titles. If the list of references includes several \nworks by the same author, they are presented on the basis of the publication dates, starting from the earliest. If the list of references includes several works by the same author that have \nbeen published in the same year, they are listed on the basis of the first letter of their titles \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n42  \n  and the small letter specifying the order is added to the publication year in both in- text \nreferences and the list of references (e.g. 2004a, 2004b).  \nCorrect formatting of a source entry depends on the type of source \u2013 to this end, it must first \nbe determined whether the source is a book, a chapter from a book, a journal article or a \nwebsite. The respective information on sources  is obtained from the data presented in the \nsource, for example, the title page of a book and its reverse side.  \nReferences and source entries can be easily managed and compiled with reference \nmanagement software (e.g. Mendeley), which helps to ensure that  all in -text references have \ncorresponding source entries in the list of references. The author must ensure compliance of \nautomatically prepared source entries with the EUAS guidelines themselves, where needed.  \nThe entry compilation rules that apply to di fferent types of sources are described below.

Plagiarism  \nThe concept of plagiarism is closely related to referencing. Theft of intellectual property, i.e. \nplagiarism is a serious breach of academic ethics, as it involves failure to acknowledge the \nauthors of ideas and opinions used in a paper.  \nThe most obvious case of plagiarism is presenting the work of another author or parts thereof \nin your work without referring to the author. The following cases are also plagiarism:  \n\u2022 another author\u2019s text is presented word for word or the text of si milar solutions like \nChatGPT and there is a reference to the source, but no quotation marks are used to \nmark the citation  \n\u2022 a source is referred to, but only  a few words have been changed when summarising \nor paraphrasing the original text  \n\u2022 part of the text of the source used is referred to, but the paper includes text parts \nwithout a reference to the source used  \n\u2022 incorrect source information is presented so that the source used cannot be located  \n\u2022 a reference is made to a source that has not been used, for in stance, a foreign  language \nwork, but the paper uses an Estonian source, or to an original work, but the paper uses a source where the original text has been summarised or translated  \nIt is unacceptable to present an assessed paper or use your earlier paper s without referring to \nthem.  \nIn the event of plagiarism, the respective provisions of the EUAS Code of Ethics are applied.  \n  \n  \n\nComposing and formatting student papers   \n50  \n  5. SUPERVISION AND DEFENCE OF STUDENT PAPERS  \n5.1. Supervision of student papers  \nBoth research papers and educational student papers ar e above all individual works. The \nformer are compiled in cooperation with a supervisor while others are prepared either under \ngroup guidance or as independent work depending on the requirements set out in the subject \nprogramme or by the lecturer.  \nThe role  of the supervisor in composing a research paper is above all guiding: they support \nstudents in specifying the topic, explaining the research problem and objective and the \nselection of methods, instruct them in choosing sources, consult during the research process \nand provide feedback on the paper being written at different stages of work.  \nSupervising begins with a mutual agreement between a student and their supervisor, which \ninvolves specifying the research topic, the contents and schedule of research co mpilation \nand supervising activities: the stages of work, mutual agreements on the organisation of \nfeedback provision and other questions.  \nThe supervisor has the right not to allow a paper submitted via the Study Information System \nto be reviewed if it does not comply with the EUAS requirements set for respective student \npapers.  \n5.2. Submission, defence and assessment of student papers  \nThe internship reports and final papers and Master\u2019s theses compiled in the course of studies  \nare only submitted electronical ly in the written papers environment of the EUAS Study \nInformation System in accordance with the deadlines set out in the academic calendar. A \npaper is considered presented on time if it has been submitted to the Study Information \nSystem by the established  time and in accordance with the requirements. The submission \nrequirements of other student papers are determined by the lecturer of the respective subject. The copyrights of student papers belong to the author and the Estonian Entrepreneurship \nUniversity of Applied Sciences.  \nFinal papers and Master\u2019s theses are defended during public sessions in front of a defence \ncommittee.

(2012)  \nOfficial mentorship programmes, which are structured based on clear standards and related \nto organisations\u2019 objectives, are increasingly acknowledged as global best practices. Mentorship is deemed to have a key role in, for instance, retaining employees, developing a \ncareer and skills or finding top specialists (Allen, Finkelstein & Poteet, 2011).  \nOn the website of AS X, the company is introduced as an organisation that cares about its \nemployees, values their contribution and aims to offer them the best environment for \npersonal and professional development. To date, the induction of new employees has been \nbased on an approach that involves the necessary training and appointment of a mentor. At \nthe same time, many of the employees who came to work for the organisation in the period \n2016- 2018 have since left the company and staff record s to indicate an increase in staff \nComposing and formatting student papers   \n54  \n  turnover. The performance appraisals from the last two years indicate that employees have \nlittle faith in the opportunities of planning a personal career in AS X. The management finds \nthat this issue could be solved by sy stematic support of employees\u2019 development via a \nmentorship programme. Considering that employees who have worked in the organisation \nfor a long time and changed positions can also be included in the new programme, \nmentorship is seen as a valuable opportunity for supporting induction and individual career \nplanning.  \nAs a result, the author\u2019s objective is to develop a mentorship programme plan for AS X. In \norder to achieve this, the author establishes the following research tasks:  \n\u2022 provide an overview of tre atments of mentorship and the general principles, \ninternational standards and best practices for creating and implementing mentorship \nprogrammes on the basis of specialist literature  \n\u2022 determine the expectations of the management and employees with regard t o the \nmentorship programme to be developed, the readiness to adopt said programme and \nthe outcome  \n\u2022 use the results to prepare a mentorship programme plan, which determines the \nprinciples of implementing mentorship in AS X  \nSchedule  \nActivities required to achieve the objective and estimated schedule:  \n1.

This procedure regulates the rules for recognising previous studies and work experience \n(hereinafter RPL ) when completing a curriculum  at the Estonian Entrepreneurship University \nof Applied Sciences (hereinafter EUAS ).  \n2. EUAS may consider the following as  part of completion of the curriculum:  \n2.1 results of formal education completed at higher schools and other study and educational \ninstitutions;  \n2.2 results of continuing education;  \n2.3 work experience and learning results acquired during daily activity.  \n3. When taki ng into account previous studies and work experience, compliance of the acquired \nknowledge, skills and attitudes with the level of learning outcomes of the EUAS curriculum, \nmodule or subject is assessed. Elective or optional courses applied for recognition  must also \nsupport the fulfilment of the study objectives of the relevant curriculum.  \n4. Taking into account previous studies of a different educational level is possible only if the \npreviously acquired knowledge is equal in terms of substance and level to t he level of the \nlearning outcomes of the relevant subject or module of the curriculum at EUAS, or if the student \nalso has professional work experience at a relevant level in the subject field that supports \nachievement of the learning outcomes.  \n5. A decision concerning the suitability of the value and level of previous studies and work \nexperience is made on a case -by-case basis.  \n6. The basis of taking into account previous studies and work experience can only be the actual \ncompletion of studies, i.e. in order fo r a course completed in another educational institution \nregistered in RPL to be recognised, its recognition in EUAS must be applied for again.  \n7. The EUAS council may, upon a proposal by the head of academic affairs, adopt as an annex \nrestrictions and a list  of courses that are mandatory to be completed at EUAS and are not subject \nto the RPL procedure.  \n8. Restrictions on applying for RPL are set down in Annex 1 to this procedure.  \n  \nII PRELIMINARY AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SCHOOLS  \n9. EUAS has the right to make prelimina ry agreements with partner schools for applying RPL within \nthe framework of certain curricula based on the following principles:   \n9.1. EUAS compares the relevant EUAS curriculum and courses with the curriculum and courses \nof the other school.   \n  \nEUAS  Procedure for Taking Previous Studies and Work Experience into Account (RPL)  \n  \n3  9.2. As a result of such a comparison, an agreement is made with the partner school to take into \naccount at EUAS the courses being completed by students (or former students) who have \nstudied in the respective curriculum. The comparison is a preliminary assessment and does \nnot ensure automatic taking account of the courses when applying for admission.  \n9.3. Each student or alumnus of the partner school applies individually for the recognition of \ncourses in accordance with the preliminary agreement of the schools and the principles a nd \nprocedure set out in this RPL procedure.   \n9.4. EUAS has the right to impose additional conditions (incl. an exam) when recognising results \nin RPL.  \n9.5. EUAS has the right to refuse recognition of courses applied to be taken into account based \non the preliminary  agreement if the applicant fails to follow the agreed procedure or a \nreasoned suspicion arises concerning the achievement of the learning outcomes by the \napplicant during the relevant courses.  \n9.6. Based on the preliminary agreement made between the schools, taking into account courses \nbeing applied for recognition may be more favourable or free for the student. The size of the \nfee or no fee is specified in the agreement concluded between the schools.   \n  \nIII CONSULTING  \n10. EUAS ensures a consulting process for a student (hereinafter  applicant ) who has applied for \nRPL. Consulting concerning the administrative questio ns of RPL is provided by a consultant of \nthe study department or a senior consultant (hereinafter RPL consultant ). In questions \nconcerning the con tent of RPL of a course requested to be transferred, the consultant is either \nthe head of curriculum or the head of the module.  \n11. The RPL consultant supports an RPL applicant by:  \n11.1. explaining to him or her the EUAS s RPL regulations, including requirements a dopted for \napplications and certifying materials and the EUAS s RPL procedure;  \n11.2. giving advice on how to fill in the application and put together the package of certifying \nmaterials;  \n11.3. informing the applicant, if necessary, about deadlines, prices and refund ing rules \nconcerning RPL.   \n12. The RPL consultant checks the submitted applications, compliance of data presented therein \nwith the certifying materials and, if they are complaint, sends the applications for assessment. \nIf a submitted application do es not meet the requirements set by EUAS, the consultant has the \nright to return it to the applicant for the introduction of additional amendments.  \n13. The RPL consultant prepares the tuition fee set -off reports of the assessed and recognised RPL \napplications .  \n  \n  \nEUAS  Procedure for Taking Previous Studies and Work Experience into Account (RPL)  \n  \n4  IV APPLYING PROCEDURE  \n14. A RPL applicant has a duty to:  \n14.1. become familiar with the learning objectives and outcomes of the courses and modules \nwithin his or her curriculum;  \n14.2. read thoroughly through the RPL procedure and rules;  \n14.3. become aware, assess and analyse his or her competences (knowledge, skills, attitudes) \nacquired previously in relation to the learning outcomes of the courses and modules \nincluded in his or her curricula;  \n14.4. submit a proper application by the deadline along with the required certifying materials;  \n14.5. follow the status of his or her application in the study information system (SIS) and, if \nnecessary, fulfil any additional conditions by the deadline given by the RPL assessor or \nRPL consultant. Failing fulfilment o f additional conditions, the application can be declared \nunacceptable.  \n15. In order for recognition of previous studies and work experience, the applicant fills in an \nelectronic application in the RPL environment of the SIS along with necessary certifying and  \nadditional materials (portfolio, description of work experience, creative work, etc.).  \n16. The following officially attested documents could be the basis for certifying previous studies \nand work experience:  \n16.1. in order to take account of the results of formal education (other higher school or \nvocational educational institution) given outside of EUAS, the applicant shall submit the \ndiploma and diploma supplement or list of grades, an extract of the diploma supplement \nor of some other document certifying educatio n (compliance of the grading system and \nlevel of education completed in a foreign state is approved by the ENIC/NARIC centre in \nEstonia) with the correct and full name of the relevant higher school or vocational \neducational institution, the name of the sub ject previously completed, its volume in credit \npoints, the substance and learning outcomes of the subject, the result, date of completion, \nand the first and surname of the lecturer indicated;   \n16.2. in order to take account of continuing education, the applica nt shall submit a continuing \neducation certificate, which, similar to a document certifying formal education, must \ninclude the course name, its volume (credit points or hours), the first and surname of the \nperson who provided continuing education and the n ame of the institution that provided \ncontinuing education, the time of continuing education, and the description of the \nsubstance and learning outcomes of the education undergone;  \n16.3. in order to take account of professional work experience, the applicant sha ll submit a \nstatement(s) confirming the place of work and length of employment (for example, an \nextract from the employment register of the Estonian Taxation and Customs Board) and \na portfolio requested by EUAS in the appropriate form (description of worki ng experience \nor creative work that attests to the achievement of the required learning outcomes).  \n  \nEUAS  Procedure for Taking Previous Studies and Work Experience into Account (RPL)  \n  \n5  17. If the original document certifying previous studies and/or work experience is not in the \nEstonian, Russian or English language, a translation of the origin al document into the English \nlanguage must be submitted, the correctness of which having been attested by the issuer of the \nrelevant document or notary.  \n18. The RPL application for taking account of previously completed formal education or continuing \neducatio n must comply with the following requirements:  \n18.1. the application is prepared correctly;  \n18.2. the data presented in the application are correct and complete;  \n18.3. the application clearly sets out the applicant s analysis of compliance of his", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:27.242894"}, {"source": "EUAS_Recognition of prior learning_RPL-2.pdf", "path": "database\\EUAS_Recognition of prior learning_RPL-2.pdf", "chunk": 1, "page_content": " Taxation and Customs Board) and \na portfolio requested by EUAS in the appropriate form (description of worki ng experience \nor creative work that attests to the achievement of the required learning outcomes).  \n  \nEUAS  Procedure for Taking Previous Studies and Work Experience into Account (RPL)  \n  \n5  17. If the original document certifying previous studies and/or work experience is not in the \nEstonian, Russian or English language, a translation of the origin al document into the English \nlanguage must be submitted, the correctness of which having been attested by the issuer of the \nrelevant document or notary.  \n18. The RPL application for taking account of previously completed formal education or continuing \neducatio n must comply with the following requirements:  \n18.1. the application is prepared correctly;  \n18.2. the data presented in the application are correct and complete;  \n18.3. the application clearly sets out the applicant s analysis of compliance of his or her \nknowledge acquire d previously or previous work experience with the learning outcomes \nof the speciality/subject/module he or she is in the process of acquiring;  \n18.4. the application is submitted along with necessary additional documents that have been \nuploaded into the electron ic environment and enable the assessor to assess the \ncompliance of the knowledge previously acquired or previous work experience with the \nlearning outcomes of the EUAS curriculum or parts thereof;  \n18.5. the application is submitted by the deadline. The deadline  for repeat application has been \ncoordinated with the RPL consultant.  \n19. The RPL application for taking into account of professional work experience or portfolio must \nmeet the following requirements:  \n19.1. professional work experience corresponds  to the course applied for recognition;  \n19.2. the work duties are described and analysed based on the learning outcomes of the course \nor module applied for recognition;  \n19.3. the portfolio is correctly put together and all required parts have been fulfilled. The tex t \nis structured, systemised, substantial, analytical, and clearly and eligibly written.  \n20. When analysing a RPL application, special attention is paid to the analysis of what the applicant \nhas learned from their experience. The portfolio clearly shows the de velopment of the \napplicant: what has been learnt through experience, which competences have been acquired, \nand how they relate to the achievement of the objectives of the curriculum and learning \noutcomes.  \n21. A RPL application is submitted by the deadline set  out in the academic calendar, ensuring \ntimely processing of the application.  \n22. Starting from the second semester, recognition of course(s) through the RPL procedure must \nbe applied for no later than by the deadline of RPL applications immediately before th e \nbeginning of the relevant semester. Applications for the recognition of course(s) of the first \nsemester are submitted no later than by the first deadline for RPL applications of the same \nsemester.   \n  \n  \nEUAS  Procedure for Taking Previous Studies and Work Experience into Account (RPL)  \n  \n6  V ASSESSMENT  \n23. A RPL application is assessed by the lecturers of the assessed courses or heads of \nmodule/heads of curricula. Internships are assessed by the head of curricula. In exceptional \ncases, the RPL assessment is carried out by the RPL assessment committee.  \n24. The RPL assessment committee has been appr oved by an order of the EUAS head of academic \naffairs. The RPL assessment committee comprises competent lecturers. If necessary, experts \noutside of the university will be engaged in the assessment process.  \n25. The EUAS RPL assessors and assessment committee w ork in compliance with the following \nassessment principles:  \n25.1. Learning outcome of experience rather than experience itself is assessed based on the \ncertifying materials submitted by the applicant.  \n25.2. The compliance of previous studies or work experience with the learning outcomes and \nobjectives of EUAS curricula is assessed.  \n25.3. The compliance of previous studies or work experience with the level of education being \nacquired by the applicant is assessed.  \n25.4. A holistic approach is taken (formal and informal (incl. through work experience) when \nassessing the results of study, taking into account that one method of learning may party \nor completely compensate another method, and the general competences (transferrable) \nare also taken into account).  \n25.5. The assessment is co nducted impartially and independently (incl. the committee does not \nassess the applicant more strictly than a regular student).  \n26. The RPL applications are usually processed within one month from the deadline set out in the \nacademic calendar for the submissi on of applications.  \n27. The RPL assessors may impose additional conditions to an applicant: request submission of \nadditional documents, give practical exercises to assess the applicant s previous studies or \nprofessional work experience, interview the applican t, or assess his or her competences with \nsome other method. If an applicant has used the same subject that he or she has completed \npreviously in more than one application, the RPL assessors take  \ninto account only the first application and the others will be deleted.   \n28. If applications are submitted outside of the deadline set out in the academic calendar or if \nadditional conditions are imposed during the assessment, the applicant has to expect the \nassessment period to be longer.  \n29. The RPL coordinator enters the decision either of recognition or non -recognition of previous \nstudies and/or work experience in the RPL environment of the SIS to the relevant application. \nThe applicant is notified of the final decision electronically through the SIS.  \n30. In order for in ternships to be taken into account, the applicant has an obligation to undergo a \npublic defence of internship, usually together with other students who are completing their \nregular internship.   \n  \nEUAS  Procedure for Taking Previous Studies and Work Experience into Account (RPL)  \n  \n7  31. Applications are not assessed during the winter and summer ho liday period.  \n32. The RPL assessors are responsible for the assessment quality.  \n  \nVI RECOGNITION  \n33. When formal education (official education) is taken into account, the date, name of the lecturer \nand the grade received in the subject in the previous educatio nal institution are entered into \nthe student s electronic record book. If the grading systems of the schools are different, the \nstudent has to first submit the grading system applied at the respective school at the time of his \nor her studies (incl. when st udy results received at schools of foreign states are taken account), \naccording to which the conformity of the grade with the EUAS grading system is ensured. \nFailure to submit a description of the grading system is only justified if the specific school doe s \nnot have a description of their grading system. In such a case, the assessment result is entered \nas a pass grade into the student s electronic record book.  \n34. When taking into account continuing education, the previous grade (if continuing education \nwas c ompleted ending with an exam or a test; in other cases, the grade is marked pass ), the \ndate the certificate attesting the passing of the course was issued and the name of the lecturer \nis entered into the student s electronic record book. Twenty -six hours of continuing education \nis deemed equal to 1 ECTS credit point, if the volume is not indicated in ECTS credit points on \nthe certificate.   \n35. When taking into account professional work experience, the assessor marks the course as \npassed without a grade. The result pass and the date of the assessment decision and the name \nof the assessor are entered into the student s electronic record book. When applying for \nrecognition of internships based on work experience, a public defence of the internship must \nbe passed  (see clause 30).  \n36. If there is a wish for a previous course to be partly recognised as part of the EUAS course, it is \npossible with an agreement between the applicant and the lecturer of the respective course \nand no RPL application has to be submitted.  \n37. Non -recognition of previous studies and work experience may be based on the fact that due to \nthe specifics of the relevant subject it may become obsolete quickly or noncompliance with the \nobjectives of the module and the learning outcomes.  \n38. If the applicant  does not agree with the decision, he or she has the right within one week of the \nannouncement of the decision to submit a written appeal to the study centre addressed to the \nname of the head of academic affairs. Appealing decisions made in connection with  RPL are \nsubject to the procedure set down in the EUAS regulation on the organisation of studies and \nthe Administrative Procedure Act.  \n  \nVII FEE FOR REVIEWING OF APPLICATION  \n39. A fee for submitting, assessing and r ecognising a RPL application is approved by the \nmanagement board of AS EEK in their Tuition fee and study service fees  document.   \n  \nEUAS  Procedure for Taking Previous Studies and Work Experience into Account (RPL)  \n  \n8  40. A fee for submitting, assessing and recognising a RPL application is calculated after the decision \non recognition/non -recog nition of RPL has been entered in the RPL environment of the SIS to \nthe relevant application.  \n   \nVIII QUALITY INSURANCE  \n41.

RPL restrictions at EUAS  \nAppropriateness of the knowledge and skills previously acquired   \n1. The knowledge acquired previously is valid and appropriate in the current time. When \nrecognising prior learning, the validity and appropriateness of prior learning is specifically \nobserved in relation to subjects which have contents that are rapidly changing and becoming \nobsolete in a short time:   \n1.1. If a student has gained professional work experience in the respective subject field, usually \nthe previous cour se is considered suitable in the context of the current course or module \nin terms of the learning outcomes. Work experience must be proven in accordance with \nChapter III of this document.  \n1.2. If a student does not have any professional work experience in the respective subject field, \nthe committee has the right to check whether the applicant has maintained the level of \nknowledge and skills by way of an interview, test or some other task.  \nVolume appropriateness of previous studies  \n2. Assessment of previous studies is based on the correspondence of learning outcomes.  \n2.1 If the volume of the course previously studied or the volume of continuing education is \nlarger than the volume prescribed by the course included in the EUAS curriculum, it can \nbe used to rep lace several courses of smaller volume or recognise the excessive ECTS \ncredit points as elective or optional courses.  \n3. If the volume of the course, continuing education or work experience is smaller than the volume \nof the course prescribed in the EUAS curr iculum or the required learning outcomes have not \nbeen achieved, the RPL assessor may issue a precept to the applicant listing the written papers, \nexams or courses and their volumes that he or she has to complete additionally for the \nfulfilment of the curr iculum. The reduction in the volume of credit points when recognising \ncourses must be compensated with elective courses in the appropriate volume.  \n4. The total volume in credit points of applications submitted in one academic year must not \nexceed the volume of the curriculum for one nominal year of study (60 ECTS).  \nOther restrictions  \n5. Previous studies and work experience are not recognised in the case of an EUAS final paper, a \nmaster s thesis or similar summative final projects.  \n6. It is only possible to recognise previous studies as elective courses to the extent prescribed by \nthe curriculum.  \n7. Professional work experience is not recognised as an elective or optional course.  \n", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:27.242894"}, {"source": "Guidelines for Enterprise internship-2.pdf", "path": "database\\Guidelines for Enterprise internship-2.pdf", "chunk": 0, "page_content": " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nESTONIAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES \nGUIDELINES FOR ENTERPRISE INTERNSHIP \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPROVED \non 14 March 2016 \nby order no. 2.5.1-276 of the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs \n  \nEstonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences \nGuidelines for Enterprise internship \n \n2/5 1. Internship \n1.1 An internship is a purposeful activity organised to achieve learning outcomes, aimed at \napplying acquired knowledge and skills in a working environment in a form determined by \nthe educational institution and under the supervision of an instructor (Standard of Higher \nEducation). \n1.2 The student, the organisation offering the internship (hereinafter 'internship institution') \nand the instructor from the school cooperate to organise the internship. \n1.3 During an Enterprise internship, students can be employed by private, public and third-\nsector organisations (with preferably at least six employees). \n2. The objectives of the intern: \n2.1 To revise the knowledge acquired in different subjects by applying them in practical work, \nto deepen this knowledge and to learn about work organisation and management related \nactivities in organisations. To develop analytical thinking skills concerning managing one's \ntasks in a work environment and providing overviews of the organisation's activity. \n3. Learning outcomes \n3.1 A student who has completed internship: \n\u2022 applies the knowledge they have acquired during studies in an internship environment; \n\u2022 purposefully develops their competences by following the objectives of the Enterprise \ninternship; \n\u2022 analyses the operations of the company based on the theoretical knowledge acquired \nduring studies, highlighting the similarities between practice and theory; \n\u2022 analyses their competence in the internship environment: evaluates their experience \nand the knowledge gained from it and repurposes further studies and development \nopportunities via the acquired experience; \n\u2022 makes proposals to improve the operations of the internship institution/organisation; \n\u2022 has the necessary skills for comprising and formatting internship reports and \npresenting the results? \n4. Internship documentation \n4.1 Documentation (internship guidelines, evaluation sheet) are available via Intranet ('\u00d5IS') of \nthe Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences (hereinafter 'EUAS'). \n4.2 The student presents two documents to the internship institution: The Enterprise \ninternship information sheet for internship institutions (Appendix 2) and the Estonian \nEntrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences student intern evaluation sheet (Appendix \n3). The student forwards the school instructor's contact information to the internship \ninstitution and, if necessary, provides the Enterprise Internship guidelines to clarify the \nspecific requirements of internship. \n4.3 The student submits an internship agreement containing information about the internship \ninstitution and the time of the internship following the format stated in Intranet. \n5. Supervising work practice \n5.1 Interns have an instructor from the school and an instructor appointed by the internship \ninstitution. \n5.2 The school instructor is usually the head of the relevant curriculum at EUAS. The final list of \nschool instructors is approved by the Head of Academic Affairs. \nEstonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences \nGuidelines for Enterprise internship \n \n3/5 5.3 The task of the school instructor is to: \n\u2022 advise the student upon establishing contact with the internship institution; \n\u2022 advise the student during the internship and comprising the practice report; \n\u2022 check whether the internship institution and job assignments meet the internship \nobjectives; \n\u2022 assess the student's internship report and give feedback. \n5.4 The school instructor can retrieve the internship institution and the institution instructor \ndata from the internship agreement. The school instructor approves the appropriateness of \nthe internship institution and the terms of the agreement in Intranet. \n5.5 The internship institution will appoint the student an instructor for the duration of the \ninternship. The rights and tasks of the internship institution instructor include: \n\u2022 familiarising themselves with the information sheet for Enterprise internship \n(Appendix 2 - information sheet) and giving students directions based on that; \n\u2022 introducing the organisation to the student and assigning them specific tasks tied to \nthe objective of the internship; \n\u2022 giving students feedback after the internship has concluded (Appendix 3 - evaluation \nsheet). \n5.6 In order to fulfil the internship objective and meet the volume criterion, the student can \nwork either full- or part-time in one (or several, as an exception) role at one or several \norganisations. The school instructor decides upon the appropriateness of the organisation \nor job position. \n6. The rights, obligations and responsibilities of the intern \n6.1 Students have the right to receive advice regarding the organisation of the internship from \nthe school (including filling in documentation, internship report criteria, internship \nevaluation, feedback, cooperation with school instructor, etc.). \n6.2 The intern is obliged to purposefully, responsibly and actively direct their learning process \nduring the internship. \n6.3 The student chooses the internship position. The student's internship institution can be the \norganisation that employs them if it meets the requirements of these guidelines and has \nbeen approved by the school instructor. \n6.4 The student coordinates their chosen internship institution with the school instructor. \n6.5 The student submits the internship agreement to the written assignment section of Intranet \nby the deadline set in the academic calendar. The agreement should contain information \nabout the internship institution and instructor and the organisation's approval of the intern. \nThe student is responsible for the adequacy of the presented data. \n6.6 If the student begins internship before the internship agreement deadline in the academic \ncalendar, then they should notify the school instructor at least a week prior to the beginning \nof the internship. \n6.7 The internship institution may conclude additional agreements with the student, if \nnecessary (e.g. agreement on proprietary liability, etc.). The student is obliged to ensure the \ninformation acquired during fulfilling internship tasks remains confidential. \n6.8 The student fills in the Enterprise internship information sheet (Appendix 2), adds the \nschool instructor's contact data and presents the sheet to the internship institution. \n6.9 During the internship, the student is obliged to follow the behavioural norms, rules and \nwork discipline agreed upon with the internship institution. \n6.10 The student is obliged to use the resources of the internship institution prudently. \n6.11 If the student ignores the regulations or rules of the organisation, the internship institution \nhas the right to terminate the internship immediately by presenting the school instructor \nwith a written notice. \nEstonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences \nGuidelines for Enterprise internship \n \n4/5 6.12 EUAS is not responsible for the student fulfilling their tasks. The internship institution has \nthe right to demand compensation for any damage the student might do to the organisation. \n7. Internship report \n7.1 The content requirements for the report are described in Appendix 1 of these guidelines. \n7.2 The volume of the report's content (from introduction to summary) is at least 15 pages and \nthe format should follow the criteria of EUAS student works. \n7.3 The internship report contains the description of specific tasks carried out during \ninternship, work outcomes and a self-analysis, during which the student should evaluate \nthe acquired skills, repurpose further professional studies and elaborate on development \nopportunities. The student should also assess whether the overall objectives of the \ninternship as well as personal goals have been achieved. Besides self-analysis, the report \nshould contain a general information section where students analyse the company's \nactivities and relate theory to practice, irrelevant to the specific position and job tasks. The \ndata necessary for comprising the report is collected during internship; additional \ninformation can be acquired later.

General information about the higher education institution:  \nEstonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences \nSuur-S\u00f5jam\u00e4e 10a, Tallinn \n2. Completing an Internship I is a requirement for completing all applied higher education \ncurricula at the Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences (hereinafter \nEUAS). \n3. The Internship I should be completed after the first year. By the time internship begins, the \nstudents have acquired base knowledge about companies' work organisation and activities. \nThe time spent at the position depends on the curricula but lasts approximately 320 academic \nhours (240 hours), i.e. 6 work weeks. \n4. The aim of the internship is to revise the knowledge acquired in different subjects by applying \nthem in practical work, to deepen this knowledge and to learn about work organisation and \nmanagement related activities in organisations. Another objective is to develop analytical \nthinking skills concerning managing one's tasks in a work environment and providing \noverviews of the organisation's activity. \n5. In order to fulfil the internship objective and meet the volume criterion, the student can work \neither full- or part-time in one (or several, as an exception) role in one or different \norganisations. \n6. Interns have an instructor from the school and an instructor appointed by the internship \ninstitution. \n7. The school instructor is usually the head of the relevant curriculum at EUAS.

INTRODUCTION  \n \nThe plan of action in the event of a fire (hereinafter the Plan) has been compiled to describe the \naccommodation building at 10 Suur-S\u00f5jam \u00e4e street , Tallinn. The Plan has been prepared \npursuant to article 6(3) of the Fire Safety Act . The content of the Plan conforms to regulation \nno. 43 of 1 September 2010 by the Minister of the Interior on \u2018 The requirements for a plan of \naction in the event of a fire and for organization of an evacuation training drill and fire \ntraining drill \u2019. \n \nThe Plan aims to provide an overview of the building -specific fire hazards at 10 S uur-S\u00f5jam \u00e4e \nstreet , the relevant prevention measures as well as the sequence of actions in case of a fire and \nevacuation and evacuation diagrams.  \n \nThe person responsible for the fire safety of the building must organize employees\u2019 briefing \nabout the Plan. Each employee must confirm that they have read the plan by signing the relevant \nform.  \n \nThe Plan must be reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the  following \ncases :  \n\u2022 if there has been a fire or other accident in the building;  \n\u2022 if the legal acts used as the basis for the plan have been amended;  \n\u2022 if new fire safety installations or rescue equipment have been taken into use in the \nbuilding or on the  premises;  \n\u2022 if rooms have been rebuilt in such a way that evacuation principles have been changed.  \n \nThe building at 10 Suur-S\u00f5jam \u00e4e street, Tallinn, is on the list of buildings whose owners must \nsubmit a fire safety self -inspection report to the Rescue Board once a year (buildings where education \nand research facilities operate and where more than ten people are permanently present). A n \norganization which has the obligation to present the fire safety report must hold a fire safety training \nsession and fire drill at least once per year. The theory session comprises a lecture about fire safety \nawareness, evacuation and actions in the even t of a fire. The fire drill comprises the entire building \nevacuation drill.  \n \n2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FEATURES WHICH AFFECT ACTIONS \nIN THE EVENT OF A FIRE AND EVACUATION  \n \n2.1 Characteristics of the building  \n \nThe building is classified as having a fire-resistance \nrating TP 1 \u2013 fire-proof . \nThe purpose of the building in terms of fire safety belongs to \ncategory II \u2013 accommodation building. The whole building\u2019s \nnet floor area  is 1497 .7 m2. \nThe total number of beds in the \nbuilding is 91. \nThe building is in use around the clock \nfrom Monday through Sunday . \nThere is a receptionist or attendant on duty in the building at all \ntimes.  \n \n \n4  The building at 10 Suur-S\u00f5jam \u00e4e street , Tallinn, is a three -floor accommodation building. On \nthe 1st floor next to the entrance there is the receptionist\u2019s office, the self -service laundry and \nutility rooms. There are accommodation rooms in the remaining part of the 1st floor. On the \n2nd and the 3rd floor, there are mainly accommodation rooms; next to th e first staircase there \nare utility rooms and common areas. The accommodation solution features units in which there \nis a common ante -room with a kitchen ette and hygiene facilities per two or three bedrooms .   \n \nTo prevent the spread of smoke and fire, the building is divided into various fire compartments. \nThe boiler room, stairwells, floors and accommodation units (bedrooms with the bathroom and \nkitchen combined with the ante -room) are all separate fire compartm ents. The building is joined \nwith the university building located next to it by the gallery on the 3rd floor equipped with fire \ndoors on both sides.  \nSmoke control is provided by means of the windows which can be opened in the stairwells. \nThe roof of the fi rst stairwell (opening to Suur -S\u00f5jam \u00e4e street) is fitted with a cupola skylight \nfor smoke removal.

The buildi ng is empty \nduring the night . \n \n3.1.3  Response to emergency  \n \nThe employee responsible for fire safety in the building and the adjoining territory is the study \nenvironment manager. From 08:30 to 17:00 the staff responsible for evacuation and identifying \nthe location of the automatic fire -alarm signal are Tallinn EUAS study organization specialists \nin accordance with their work schedule.  \n \n3.1.4  Emergency escape route s and exits  \n \nThe building must  be evacuated through fire escape  stairwells. Exit routes, emerg ency escape \nroute s and emergency  exits are marked with evacuation signs. The maximum length of an \nemergency escape route  from any point in a room to two exits is 60 meters.  The building is \nequipped with emergency lights ensuring that emergency escape route s are lit. In case of a power \noutage, the lights along emergency escape routes can provide autonomous lighting for 1 hour. \nAs the building is divided into fire compartments, people can be evacuated to the parts of the \nbuilding  which are the farthest  remove d from the scene of fire .  \n \nThere are 5 emergency exits. On the basement floor, the emergency escape route goes through \nthe corridor directly outside through the doors located on either end; another route goes through \nthe door in Wing A, and one more leads  outside through the corridor in Wing B.   \nThe emergency escape route from the 1st floor of the main building goes through the corridor to \nthe fire escape stairwells , which form  separate fire compartments , at either end or through the \ncorridor in Wing A to  the balcony and to the ground down a stone staircase.  \nThe emergency escape route from the 2nd floor II goes to the fire escape stairwells, which form \nseparate fire compartments, at either end of the corridor . \n \nThe doors along the emergency escape route o pen in the direction \nof the route destination.  \n \n3.2 Emergency fire extinguishing equipment and fire safety installations in the \nbuilding and their description  \n \nThe following fire safety installations and safety systems are used in the building : \n \n\u2022 6-kilog ram ABC dry powder extinguishers ; \n\u2022 a 6-kilogram  CO2 gas extinguisher in the server room ; \n\u2022 the automatic fire -alarm system (the AFS) with its control unit located in the stairwell \nnext to the building entrance door ; \n\u2022 smoke control system in the corridors ; \n\u2022 sprinkler systems  (automatic fire extinguishing system ) in the corridors ; \n\u2022 emergency lighting.  \n \nTo ensure that all the installations and systems are operational, their owner must organize regular \n7  inspections, control and maintenance. Such activities a re described in more detail for each \ninstallation and system in the building \u2019s fire safety organization folder.  \n8  3.3 Description of the emergency fire extinguishing equipment and fire safety \ninstallations  \n \nThe fire extinguishers  in use are m ainly 6 -kilog ram ABC dry powder extinguishers and one 6 -\nkilogram CO 2 fire extinguisher in the server room. The extinguishers are located in specially \nlabeled cabinets or  placed  visibly on the walls; where necessary, signs referring to the location \nare used.  \n \nThe autom atic fire -alarm system (AFS) detects smoke in the building and notifies the people \nin the building about it by means of the alarm signal. In addition, one can activate the alarm \nsignal manually by pressing the button of the manual call point. The AFS contr ol unit is located \nin the stairwell next to the building entrance door. The study organization specialist is \nresponsible for checking AFS signals and responding to them.  The ventilation system is \nswitched off when the fire -alarm system is activated.  \n \nSmo ke is removed from the fire escape stairwell through windows that can be opened, and \nmechanical smoke control is provided  in emergency escape corridors.  \n \nThe purpose of the  sprinkler system  (automatic fire extinguishing system) is to contain the \nspreading  of fire in the area protected by the fire extinguishing system in the event of a fire and, \nif possible, extinguish the fire. The sprinkler system has been installed in the corridors of the \nbuilding. The sprinkler system receives water from  the city water supply system, and its feeding \nvalve is located in the sprinkler control assembly .    \n \nEmergency lights  provide autonomous lighting  for one hour in case of a power outage. \nEmergency lights illuminate general public areas, emergency escape routes and emerge ncy exits. \nEmergency lights are located above emergency exits to mark the emergency exits which can be \nused for evacuating the building. Emergency lights are also used for indicating the direction \ntowards the emergency exit . \n \n \n4.

INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT REPORTING THAT A FIRE HAS OCCURRED  \n \n \n6.1 Receiving a n alert about a fire and reporting it  \n \nPeople in the building are  notified about a fire by means of a fire-alarm signal . The fire-alarm \nsignal  starts automatically  when the  AFS is activated (when the smoke from the fire reaches a \nsmoke detector or a sprinkler bulb breaks because of the high temperature).  \n \n \n  \nPhoto : man ual call point   \nThe fire alarm signal is transmitted in the whole building simultaneously. The AFS activating in \nthe event of a fire is the primary means of giving a fire -alarm signal. If the automatic fire -alarm \nsystem has not been activated, the person w ho has discovered the fire must push the button on a \nmanual call point, inform the study organization specialist  about the fire and notify other \npeople on the floor where the fire is located that a fire has started. Information about an \nemergency in the bu ilding can be provided by means of a verbal notification or by pressing  the \nbutton on a manual call point.  A manual call point is normally located near an emergency exit \nor on the wall along an emergency escape route.  \n \n \nYou must press the glass  on the manu al call point until the red light is on . Make sure that you \npress hard!  Information about discovering a fire must be given to all colleagues in a loud and \nclear voice .  \n \nInformation about a fire or other emergency must be provided to the Alarm Centre by c alling \nthe 112 emergency line.  \n \nWhen calling the Alarm Centre, provide the most important information \nfirst:  \n \n- ADDRESS  (Suur-S\u00f5jam \u00e4e 10a, Tallinn) \n \n- WHAT HAS HAPPENED  (what is burning, how large the fire is ) \n \n- ARE THERE PEOPLE IN DANGER (injured or tra pped in the smoke ) \n \n- WHO IS CALLING  (your name, position and telephone number ) \n \n \n \nDo not end the call until you are told to do so; the operator might need additional information. \nIf the hazard situation changes significantly while you are waiting for the rescue team, inform \n\n13  the Alarm Centre about it.  \n \nCalls to the 112 emergency line can be made from a landline or mobile phone without dialing \nany area code.  \n \nIf necessary, the study organization specialist will inform the following in the \nassembly area abou t the event:  \n\u2022 the rector  \n\u2022 the manager of Mainor \u00dclemiste \nAS  \n \n \nIn case the AFS is activated, the security company team \nwill also arrive on site.  \n \n \n7.   EVACUATION GUIDELINES  \n \n7.1 General principles of evacuation  \n \nWhen evacuating the building : \n\u2022 follow emerg ency escape routes which are marked with emergency lights;  \n\u2022 if you find yourself in a room filled with smoke, stay as low as possible while  you go;  \n\u2022 priority must be given to evacuating people who are in the hazardous area;  \n\u2022 staying calm is the most imp ortant thing during evacuation;  \n\u2022 if you are leading the evacuation, speak in a calm and loud voice and seize the initiative;  \n\u2022 people must stay calm while moving on emergency escape routes;  \n\u2022 dangerous situations might occur in tight spaces (doors etc.) w here many people will try \nto pass through at the same time.  \n \nThe signal for evacuation is the AFS alarm signal or verbal instructions. EUAS employees must \nverbally pass on this information to students and visitors.  \n \n \n7.2 If you are in a situation with no way out and need to be rescued  \n \n\u2022 Try to stay calm and retain self -control;  \n\u2022 if you cannot leave the room, close (do not lock !) the door  and,", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:35.859494"}, {"source": "Plan of Action in the Event of a Fire-2.pdf", "path": "database\\Plan of Action in the Event of a Fire-2.pdf", "chunk": 3, "page_content": " if you find yourself in a room filled with smoke, stay as low as possible while  you go;  \n\u2022 priority must be given to evacuating people who are in the hazardous area;  \n\u2022 staying calm is the most imp ortant thing during evacuation;  \n\u2022 if you are leading the evacuation, speak in a calm and loud voice and seize the initiative;  \n\u2022 people must stay calm while moving on emergency escape routes;  \n\u2022 dangerous situations might occur in tight spaces (doors etc.) w here many people will try \nto pass through at the same time.  \n \nThe signal for evacuation is the AFS alarm signal or verbal instructions.

It must be \ndecided on the spot who will start identifying the cause  of the alarm signal and who will \nstart the evacuation.  \n\u2022 The person responsible for the rental area of  the cafeteria or the evacuation manager is \nresponsible for the evacuation from the area they are renting.  \n \n7.4 Assembly point  \n \nThe primary assembly point is in the park behind the university building. Upon arriving at the \nassembly point, the evacuation m anager or the person appointed by them must register who of \nthe employees are present to check that everyone has left the building. If anyone is missing, \ntheir location must be identified (by calling them or asking other employees and students). The \nhead o f the rescue  operation  must be informed about the situation.  \nIf there are people with limited mobility in the building, the head of the rescue operation  must \nbe certainly informed about it. In case of a lengthy incident, actual non -drill fire or adverse \nweather conditions , the evacuated people will be temporarily sheltered in the Hostel at 10 Suur- \nS\u00f5jam\u00e4e street, Tallinn.  \n15  8.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO THE AFS ALARM SIGNAL  \n \n8.1 Instructions for responding to the activation of the AFS alarm signal  \n \n\u2022 When the alarm signal sounds, stop your work immediately and check your working area \nto make sure everything is all right in this area;  \n\u2022 if you discover a fire, first try to extinguish it with emergency extinguishing equipment . \nDo not put yourself at ris k in the process!  \n\u2022 switch off the equipment which is not meant for working unattended;  \n\u2022 take your outdoor clothes with you if you can;  \n\u2022 before leaving the room, close all windows and doors ( Do not lock  the doors ! Rescue \nworkers might need to enter the r oom). Closing the windows and doors is necessary for \npreventing the spread of smoke and fire;  \n\u2022 leave the building, using the shorte st emergency escape route, but avoid going through \nthick smoke and choose an alternative escape route in such case;  \n\u2022 help t hose who need it and lead them to the nearest emergency exit ; \n\u2022 go to the specified assembly point.  \n \nIf it becomes apparent that an employee or anyone else who was in the building is in a hazardous \narea because of thick smoke or high temperature, inform th e head of the rescue operation at \nonce. The head of the rescue operation is the person wearing a blue helmet in the rescue team \nwhich arrives on site first (and later the operations manager of the rescue operation, who will be \nwearing a red helmet).  \n \n8.2 The following must identify the location and cause  of the AFS alarm signal : \n \n\u2022 Study organization specialist(s).  It will be decided on the spot who will start \nidentifying the cause  of the alarm signal and who will start the evacuation.    \n \n \n8.3 Instructions for the evacuation manager\u2019s response to the AFS \nactivation  \n \n\u2022 Identify the location of the alarm activation on the AFS panel, using the AFS \ndiagrams;  \n\u2022 check the alarm location;  \n\u2022 in case of the actual fire call the Alarm Centre line 112;  \n\u2022 if possible, u se emergency fire extinguishing equipment to try to contain or \nextinguish the fire but only if you do not put yourself at risk in the process;  \n\u2022 start the evacuation from the evacuation area you are in charge of, directing \nemployees and clients out of the building through the nearest emergency exit;  \n\u2022 before leaving the room, close all windows and doors ( Do not lock  the doors ! \nRescue workers might need to enter the room). Closing the windows and doors is \nnecessary for preventing the spread of smoke and fire ; \n\u2022 at the assembly point, check that all the employees and clients have left the building;  \n\u2022 meet the rescue team, report to the head of the rescue operation and provide them with the \nFAS location diagrams and floor plans of the areas filled with smoke;  \n\u2022 inform the people about the cause s of the AFS activation;  \n16  \u2022 the person responsible for the general fire safety of the building (the manager of \nMainor \u00dcl emiste) must also be informed about the alarm signal.  \n \nNB! The cause  of the AFS alarm activation must b e \nidentified every time it is activated . \n \nAn entry in the AFS maintenance log must be made about each alarm activation  (the entry must \nbe made by the evacuation manager or the person responsible for the fire safety of the rented \npremises).  \n \nIf the alarm i s activated by the button of the manual call point pressed without a cause , by \nsteam, dust, smoke or any other cause  than an actual fire, the study specialist  must be \nimmediately informed by phone (6101900), and the cause  of the false alarm must be \nelimina ted as soon as possible.  \nIn case of a false alarm, the study specialist must : \n\u2022 identify the location of the alarm activation on the AFS panel, using the AFS \ndiagrams;  \n\u2022 check the alarm location;  \n\u2022 inform people in the building;  \n\u2022 if checking the alarm lo cation reveals that the alarm was false, switch off the \nsound signal and abort the alarm;  \n\u2022 inform the security company control center  that the alarm was false if it could \nnot be aborted within the first 3 minutes (the phone number is in the cabinet where \nthe AFS control unit is located).  \n \n \n9.   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOPERATION WITH THE RESCUE TEAM  \n \nA rescue team will generally arrive to the site approximately within 5 \u201410 minutes after \nreceiving the alert. In case of a fire during non -business hours, when the building is locked, it \ncan be accessed with the key which is safekept in the Hostel at 10 Suur -S\u00f5jam \u00e4e street, T allinn.  \n \nIt is important to provide the head of the rescue \noperation with initial information.  \n \nUpon the arrival of the rescue team, inform it s head \nabout the following : \n\u2022 what is burning, where it is and how large the fire is;  \n\u2022 if any people have remained in the building, how serious is the danger they are in, and if \nthere are any injured;  \n\u2022 which route is the best to reach the injured ( or the scene of fire);  \n\u2022 do not leave the incident site; the rescue team might need more information about the \ncharacteristics of the building;  \n\u2022 information about fire safety installations and utility systems:  \n- the main distribution board  (on the basement floo r); \n- the location of the AFS control unit (next to the main entrance door; the diagrams \ncan be found there as well, or the study organization specialist has taken and \ngiven  them  to the head of the rescue operation) ; \n-  the location of the control buttons  of the smoke control system (in the corridors \n\u2013 next to the AFS control unit; or the study organization specialist has taken and \n17  given  them  to the head of the rescue operation ); \n- the control assembly of the automatic fire extinguishing system (in the wate r \nmetering unit);  \n\u2022 locations of distribution boards (on the first floor and basement floor of the building)  \n  \n \n \nAPPENDIX  1.

(In the case of multiple courses, you may want to \ndraw up a table in order to provide your overview.)  \n- Why do you feel your experiential learning should be taken into cons ideration? \n(Provide well -argued reasoning.)  \n- What parts is your self -analysis report made up of, and which parts cover which \naspects?  \n- Is there anything else that is important to you and to which you would like to \ndraw the attention of the assessment committee?   \n \n4 \n CV \n \nDraw up a CV for yourself in which you highlight all of your learning experience, such \nas school education, refresher training and everyday life (e.g. in the working \nenvironment).  \nFor each experience, provide a summary of the most important  thing you learned from \nit that you want to highlight and emphasise.  Example:  \nEducation     \n2014 -2017   University of \nTartu   BA in Economics   In addition to the knowledge of the \nsubject I attained, I value the \nexperience I gained in undertaking \nresearch: I now know how to gather, \nanalyse and generalise the data I \nneed to fulfil a research task and how \nto draw connections between theory \nand resul ts. During this period I was \nalso the senior student on my course, \nthanks to which I gained more \nexperience of and skills in \ncommunication and organisation.  \netc.    \n \n  \n \n5 \n SELF -ANALYSIS  \n \nIn order to provide evidence of fulfilling every learning outcome of each course you \nare applying to have taken into consideration , you will have to complete a self -analysis \nin which you describe and analyse how you achieved a specific learning outcome of a \nspecific course. You may base your self -analysis on STARR or anothe r method of self -\nanalysis.  \nThe text must be structured. It makes sense to provide subheadings for different parts \nof the text, e.g. by learning outcome. In any event, the self -analysis pertaining to each \nlearning outcome must include two parts, with the em phasis being on the second, as \nfollows:  \n1) Describing the experience \u2013 Outline the experience through which you fulfilled \nthe learning outcome: what happened, what your duties, role, responsibilities \nand objectives were in the situation, what action you took in the given situation, \nwhether you acted independently or with guidance, what result you achieved \nand the extent to which the result depended on the action you took.  \n2) Reflecting on the experience \u2013 Analyse the experience and indicate how it is \nconnected to  a specific learning outcome: what the meaning/importance of the \nexperience was to you, the team and the company, which aspects of it were \nparticularly interesting and important to you, what alternative action you might \nhave taken, why you chose the approa ch that you did, how you would act in a \nsimilar situation in the future, whether you would do anything different and \nwhat this would be and why, whether you have recently found yourself in a \nsimilar situation and whether the result was the same and why, ho w you rate \nyour ability to cope \u2013 giving specific examples (e.g. client feedback or growth \nin visitor numbers, not simply that you think you coped well), what feedback \nother parties gave you on your actions and the results, whether the feedback is \nin line with your own assessment, what knowledge and skills you gained from \nthe experience and how the experience is linked to the learning outcome of the \ncourse you are applying to have taken into consideration.  \n \nYou may like to follow the following process in compiling your texts:  \n1) Look up the learning outcomes of the course you are applying to have taken \ninto consideration and write them down. Read through them several times and \n \n6 \n try to understand them: what skills and knowledge does completing the course \nrequir e? Be honest and constructively critical in regard to yourself. For \nexample, if it states in the learning outcome that the student must be familiar \nwith the key theories in the field in question, you will need to make it clear to \nyourself which theories ar e being referred to and whether you truly are familiar \nwith them \u2013 theories are not learned on the basis of experience alone, but rather \nyou also need to e.g. read professional literature. (Have you read such \nliterature, or taken a refresher training cours e dealing with the theories in \nquestion?)  \n2) Think about the kind of experience that could prove your fulfilment of a \ncertain learning outcome.  \n3) Organise your thoughts. (For example, draw up an ideas chart.)  \n4) Write your first draft using the abovementioned questions or the STARR \nmethod to guide you.  \n5) Look for or obtain the evidence you will need (job description, character \nreference from a colleague/manager, documents drawn up in the course of \nyour work that prove you have a certain skill, etc.).  \n6) Read through  your self -analysis report again and evaluate the following:  \n- Are all of the learning outcomes covered?  \n- Is the text sufficiently clear, specific, explanatory, relevant and \ncomprehensible?  \n- Is the text structured in an understandable way and easy to follow?  \n- Have you clearly highlighted what you learned from your experience?  \n7) Make any necessary corrections. If needed, ask one of your lecturers or an \nRPL advisor for feedback.  \n \n \n \n7 \n SOURCES USED  \n \nA self -assessment analysis is an academic text like any other: it requires correct \nreferencing and a list of sources if it includes the views, ideas, data, etc. of other \nauthors.   \n \n8 \n Annex  1. \n \nAdd as annexes the materials evidencing your fulfilment of the le arning outcomes set \nout in the learning narratives in your analysis.  \n \nDivide them into two groups: direct and indirect evidence.  \n1) Direct evidence \u2013 Anything you compiled yourself or for the compiling of \nwhich you were chiefly responsible (e.g. projects, learning materials and \nguidelines)  \n2) Indirect evidence \u2013 Documents compiled and issued by someone else (e.g. \ncertificates, letters of reference and feedback)  \n \nMake sure that the evidence your submit as annexes is true, sufficient, valid, authentic \nand releva nt. This means that you should not just submit any documents as evidence, \nbut only appropriate and carefully selected documents directly linked to the learning \noutcomes of the course you wish to be taken into consideration and to which you \nmade reference i n your learning narratives.  \n \n", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:38.877739"}, {"source": "RPL_Supporting material for applicants.pdf", "path": "database\\RPL_Supporting material for applicants.pdf", "chunk": 0, "page_content": " \n  \n \n \n \nGUIDELINES FOR RPL APPLICANTS  \n \nI BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR APPLICATION ................................ ................................ ..........................  1 \nII WHAT CAN I HAVE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, AND HOW DO I GO ABOUT IT?  .............  1 \nIII SUBMITTING YOUR APPLICATION  ................................ ................................ ................................ ........  3 \nIV IMPOSING OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND MAKING CORRECTIONS  ..........................  5 \nV ACCOMPANYING FEES  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ . 5 \n \n \n \nI BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR APPLICATION  \nBefore submitting your application, you should critically assess the skills and knowledge you have \ngained, as follows:  \n\u2022 Is the knowledge you have gained in line with the learning outcomes and objectives \nof the Maino r course in question in terms of content, level and scope? Review the \ncourse description and programme, where available.  \n\u2022 Have you retained, to a sufficient extent, the skills and knowledge you have gained? \nAre they still valid and up to date?  \n\u2022 Can you provide evidence of your skills/knowledge?  \nIf you can answer \u2018yes\u2019 to all of these questions, it is likely that your skills and knowledge will be \nable to be taken into consideration in the completion of the curriculum on the basis of your RPL \napplication. Review the RPL rules and process and submit your correctly completed application \nonline by the deadline marked on the academic calendar in SIS.  \nNote:  The RPL process is subject to fees. Review the price list in the \u2018Tuition fees\u2019 document.  \n \nII WHAT CAN I HAVE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, AND HOW DO I GO ABOUT IT?  \nActual performance is the sole basis of prior learning and work experience being taken into \nconsideration. Mainor may take the following into consideration in the fulfilment of a curriculum:  \n\u2022 results of formal education completed in other institutions of higher education and \ntraining , \n\u2022 results of continuing education , \n\u2022 skills and knowledge gained fro m work experience . \n\nGuidelines for RPL applicants  \n 2 \n \nOfficially certified evidence  must be attached to your RPL application, as follows:  \n\u2022 In order for the results of formal education obtained outside of Mainor  (i.e. in \nanother institution of higher education and training) to be taken into consideration \nyou must submit:  \no an academic transcript/grade report/certificate of academic \nachievement/diploma supplement  and/or a diploma , on which must be \nindicated the name of the course, its volume in credit points, your results, the \ndate on which you completed the course and the name of your lecturer; and  \no the course description (i.e. the document issued by the school describing the \ncontent and learning outcomes of the course).  \n\u2022 In order for the results of continuing education to be taken into consideration you \nmust submit:  \no a certificate of continuing education , which must include the name of the \ncourse, its volume (in credit points or hours), the name of the person who \nprovided the continuing education and the name of the institution, the date on \nwhich you completed the course and a description of the content and learning \noutcomes of the course.  \n\u2022 In order for the results of work experience to be taken into consideration you must \nsubmit:  \no a certificate (or certificates plural)  confirming your workplace and length of \nservice, signed by the employer/company, agency or institution. In taking \nwork experience into consideration, students must prove that they been \nemployed for at least one year during the last six years. Documents ma y also \nbe submitted concerning duties (such as the job description), feedback, etc.; \nand \no the self-analysis report  on work experience on the form required by Mainor. \nIn applying to have experiential learning gained through work taken into \nconsideration, you  must prove that you have learned from your experience \nand draw connections between your experiential learning and the learning \noutcomes of the course. The length of the main body of the report should be at \nleast 9000 characters. A sample self -analysis rep ort can be found in SIS under \n\u2018Documents\u2019 > \u2018Documents for students\u2019 > \u2018RPL documents\u2019.  \nNote:  Only submit work experience to be taken into consideration as RPL practical training if you \nwant the experience you gained in a company that you no longer work fo r or that no longer exists \nto be considered. In other cases (e.g. if you still work for the company), complete regular practical \ntraining and submit a practical training agreement by the deadline.  \nTo avoid problems that may lead to you submitting an applic ation that does not meet the \nrequirements, contact an RPL advisor, e.g. if you are not sure how to go about compiling the \napplication, whether the evidence you have is sufficient/correct, what the precise RPL process is \nor what the key requirements are. Th e advisor should not be viewed as a co -author of your \napplication and will not provide any substantive evaluation of its potential assessment.  \nGuidelines for RPL applicants  \n 3 \n \nIII SUBMITTING YOUR APPLICATION  \nThe compiling, submitting and processing of RPL applications takes place online,  and each stage \nof the process is subject to a deadline marked on the academic calendar in SIS.  \nIn order to have previous experience taken into consideration, you must draw a connection \nbetween it and a course (or courses plural) in the Mainor curriculum i n question. If you would \nlike to add more than one course to your application, you should establish a separate connection \nfor every course.  \n\u2022 One course added to application : \n \n\u2022 Two courses added to application : \n \n\u2022 Combined connection added to application: a number of previous learning \nexperiences form the basis of taking one Mainor course into consideration : \n \n \n\nGuidelines for RPL applicants  \n 4 \n \n\u2022 Combined connection added to application: a previous learning experience forms the \nbasis of taking a number of Mainor courses into consideration.  \nNote:  Credit points from a previous learning experience are only taken into \nconsideration upon the completion of a curriculum once, i.e. you should keep an eye \non the number of credit points required to complete the curriculum.  \n \n \nOnly one application can be submitted per submission deadline for RPL applications. A further \napplication can be submitted once the previous application has been fully assessed. As a rule, RPL \napplications are forwarded for assessment within a month of the deadline for submissions \nmarked on the academic calendar.  \n \n \n \n\nGuidelines for RPL applicants  \n 5 \n \nIV IMPOSING OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND MAKING CORRECTIONS  \nAlso keep an eye on your application in SIS after you have submitted it . If there are \nshortcomings in the application itself or in the evidence accompanying it, it may be returned to \nyou with comments in order for you to make corrections. These corrections must be made and \nthe application resubmitted within three working days. Once the application meets  all \nrequirements, it is forwarded for assessment. If the corrections are not made by the deadline, final \nassessment of the application will be delayed, potentially until the next round of applications.  \nRPL assessors may also impose additional requirements  on applicants : requesting the \nsubmission of additional documents, issuing them with practical tasks to assess their prior \nlearning or work experience, interviewing them or assessing their skills, knowledge and \ncompetence in some other way. In order for wo rk experience to be taken into consideration as \npractical training, applicants are obliged to mount a public defence of their practical training \nresults, generally alongside students who are undertaking regular practical training.  \n \nV ACCOMPANYING FEES  \nThe  RPL process is subject to fees . \n\u2022 These fees are only offset for courses that are paid for during the academic year.  \n\u2022 The assessment of courses set out in cooperation agreements with other educational \ninstitutions is free of charge. The fees are not offset on the basis of the price per credit \npoint.  \nAssessment and offset rates of formal and continuing education and work experience  listed \nin RPL application can be found in the document  \u2019Tuition and service fees\u2019 . \n", "processed_date": "2025-04-09T18:45:40.272078"}, {"source": "tuition.pdf", "path": "database\\tuition.pdf", "chunk": 0, "page_content": " \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTUITION FEES AND TUITION SERVICE FEES  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPROVED by  \nthe Board of AS EEK Mainor 23.10.2023  \nRegulation No.  12 \n  \n\n \nTuition fees and tuition service fees  \n2 \n The tuition fees of the Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences (EUAS) are formed \nas follows:  \n\u2022 When studying in the course system \u2013 the academic year's start fee (AYSF), the part calculated \naccording to the credit price (ECTS), which counts for 30 ECTS credits per semester (except for \nthe 3.5 year study period, which counts for 26.25 ECTS credits pe r semester and 22.5 ECTS \ncredits in the last semester) and the cost of the services specified in this document  \n\u2022 When studying according to the individual study plan \u2013 the semester start  fee (SSF), the part \ncalculated according to the credit price (ECTS) and the cost of the services specified in this \ndocument  \n\u2022 When studying as an external student \u2013 the semester start fee (SSF), the credit price (ECTS) \nand the cost of the services specified in this document  \n\u2022 When studying an extra year \u2013 from the fee of rescheduling defence, the credit price (ECTS) \nand the cost of the services specified in this document  \n \nTuition fees may vary depending on the form of study, curriculum, time of admission, location of study \nand method of tuition payment (e.g. tuition fee package), which is described in more detail in section \nIII. \n \nI TUITION FEES  \n \n1.
